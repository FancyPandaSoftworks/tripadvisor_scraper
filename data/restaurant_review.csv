440,Atithi Indian Restaurant Rotterdam,Torquin01,4 weeks ago,3,"After reading the excellent reviews here on Tripadvisor, my wife booked this restaurant for a special occasion on a Saturday night at 19.30 hrs. After we stood in line outside, waiting to be seated, we were led to a table where we were provided only the drinks menu. Looking around, the place was packed with people looking at empty plates. After half an hour(!) we were asked if we wanted to order drinks and food. After that, we had to wait another HOUR just for our appetizers, without even a basket of Papadums to keep us from getting too hungry. When I made a remark to the waiter about it, he apologized by saying that it is very busy during weekends. That, however, should not be a legitimate reason for not even asking for drinks when customers are shown their table. He did apologize several times more, but did not check during the main course if everything was still satisfactory. Also, he could have offered us our coffes for free - which could have been an opportunity to set the bad service straight. By the way, I noticed that the waitresses were really slow and working inefficiently, so the delays should really not only be blamed on the kitchen. However, I must admit that the Chicken Tikka Masala was really good, and so were the vegetable dish and the Naan breads we ordered (the Samosa was too saucy to be enjoyed we felt). And the chairs in fhe restaurant are really comfortable. All in all, I can advise the restaurant for its food - just don’t go there during the weekend."
441,Atithi Indian Restaurant Rotterdam,irfansherazi,5 weeks ago,5,"We had Dinner at Atithi and were very pleased with what we got at the cost range we paid.

445,Atithi Indian Restaurant Rotterdam,N1273VXrajeshm,"August 23, 2021",4,"Yesterday me and my 86 year old mother had to be in Rotterdam for some work and decided to drop by for a quick Indian meal before heading back to Eindhoven as it was already past 8 pm. The restaurant was chock-full yet we were given a table by Hari and despite his claims that we had to expect a long waiting time, we were served our food within 20 min. I strongly recommend the Malai Kofta and Palak Paneer which were mild, not too spicy, somewhat sweet but delicioussssssssssssss. To be eaten with rice AND butter naan. It is somewhat pricy as we paid EUR 55 for 2 main dishes, 1 soup, 2 drinks and the same meal in Eindhoven would cost EUR 35-40 but then again, Nieuwe Werk is an expensive neighbourhood in Rotterdam. Overall, a very nice experience with friendly staff and delicious food...given the fact that me and mom are Indian. Well done."

662,91Spices,Esploratore,2 weeks ago,1,"We ordered from 91 spices from a renowned delivery provider we have used for years with dozens of restaurants - order & pay - delivery timeline indicated 35 minutes - 10 minutes after order, delivery timeline indicated: 60 minutes - after 70 minutes the app said - out for delivery/confirmed by restaurant
- 30 minutes later - nothing (restaurant is max 5-10 min away by bike)

- we call the restaurant. They indicate delivery hasn’t even left yet, there is no delivery person.
- when we asked for new timeline there was none. “Maybe 10-15-30 minutes” 

So we are 100 minutes after order - with 35 min expectation. And NO new delivery timeline.

No apology
When wanting to cancel - taking no ownership, saying they cant do anything, refund, etc. 

I know there is a delivery provider in between but with previous issues using the same provider the restaurants have always picked up themselves and owned.  And these are much smaller things like missing a drink.

Amazing this place - completely respectless and still no money back. Few more days and I will be forced to file a police report for fraud."
663,91Spices,64andrep,"August 15, 2021",4,It’s been around 3 years I did not eat Indian food as where I am living now there are no Indian restaurants so it was a very nice finding when I saw this restaurant just in front of the hotel we are staying. To be honest we went there for convenience as it was first restaurant we saw after a long car journey but it became a very good surprise. The owner gave us a table outside and the waitresses did a very good job and of course the food was delicious. We are staying for some days in Rotterdam and will be visiting the city often for some years to come and for sure this place will be one we will be coming back to.
664,91Spices,MariscaZusje,"July 27, 2021",1,Ordered food last Sunday and spent the whole evening in my bathroom fomenting. Never again! Don't order the lamb or any thing at all
665,91Spices,sprincey,"July 2, 2021",3,"Was really looking forward to my visit as my friend really rates this place. Service was friendly and really good. Starter was lovely and very flavoursome, not so much the main. I had a korma. It had no flavour at all, none of the usual coconut, creamy sweetness, it was very bland. I live in Eindhoven and there is a much better Indian restaurant here."
666,91Spices,Frans_klaassen,"December 31, 2020",5,"Great food, we have been eating and had food delivered a few time already. It’s always excellent. For X-mas we had their X-mas dinner special. It was absolutely great..and even with a nice dessert added for free [thank you so much] From our trip in India we brought Thali plates...which created a real nice atmosphere and something special for x-mas"
667,91Spices,MMKKRR,"October 7, 2020",4,"Excellent curry korma! We also had the tikka curry, which was also great. They also have a good selection of spirits."
668,91Spices,kamiliaaah,"October 1, 2020",5,"Third time I went here and it's still my favourite Indian restaurant. I love the food and the service, the restaurant makes me feel like I'm actually in India. The madras was too spicy for my friends so they gave us some raita (yoghurtsauce) to eat with it. Strawberry mojito's are cheaper than most places and really good. Coming back soon :)"
669,91Spices,Jasna013,"October 1, 2020",2,"Decided to visit based on the reviews. Firstly: we have made a reservation for 6:30pm, however, when we arrived we were told that reservations for dinner are made on two shifts basis - till 7pm and after 7pm, so that we will need to wait for a couple of minutes. Those couple of minutes took precisely 45 as we were seated at 7:15pm. In the meantime, we were told to take a seat at the bar; no one showed any interest in us, no one offered us any drinks until we asked for it (if I am told that I need to wait for some time, I would expect at least a complimentary drink). Btw, this 'until 7pm-after 7pm' rule is not listed on the reservation page.
Secondly, unlike other tables, we were not served papadums with sauces while we were waiting for our food - reason unknown. Food was ok; however, service through ipads is not really working. Our orders could not go through so they had to take our ipad and they didn't bring it back until we asked what was going on with our food and drinks. None of the orders went through so we could have been sitting there for a while in case we did not initiate service. At the end, we received an invoice for two tables, not just for ours so that had to be sorted out as well on our initiative.
All in all, they are either understaffed so that is why some of the orders are quite late (we had to wait for our naan 20 minutes and it came when we have finished our meal) or there are other organisational issues they need to sort out."
670,91Spices,CatarinaB43,"August 21, 2020",5,"Great Indian food, with friendly staff guiding us through the menu. 91Spices is probably the best Indian restaurant I have ever tried. I found the digital ordering system a bit cumbersome and would have preferred printed menus."

Prices are good too! 
My only complaint would be that when you leave the place you smell like fried noodles... Perhaps they should add more ventilation to their kitchen. But food was 5/5. Delicious!"

822,VINEUM,jer0envv,"August 16, 2019",4,"Nice restaurant on the 1st floor of a authentic mansion; close to the city centre and the Witte de Withstreet (many nice bars!!!). We had a 3-course dinner (seafood/meat), 2 bottles of wine (Albarino/Valpolicella), coffees and after dinner drinks. Food was well prepared, well seasoned and service was great. Service was good and the sommelier is a great guy. We paid 260 euro for the for of us and is was well worth the money."
823,VINEUM,Saudadesdecasa,"June 16, 2019",4,"Not a first time in this restaurant... food is excellent and wine cart is phenomenal! Environment is great. Only thing is that with the exception of the sommelier, the rest of the staff is not the kindest or sympathetic as it should be for a place such as this where you expect excellency in all ways. It is a pitty. After 3x having the same sort of treatment coming from the same staff it is clear that is not about the staff having a bad day, but just the way they are: directive, doing their job sufficiently not adding more than that, therefore missing pleasant and welcoming atitude. 
If you seek for quality with super kind staff, where the client treatment is a major plus for you, then this might not be the best choice."
824,VINEUM,michield146,"April 5, 2019",3,I visited Vineum on a Thursday night with my son. The room was nicely decorated with enough space between tables and wine bottles on the windowsill. The restaurant was situated on the 2nd floor and there was not an elevator or escalator. We chose the 4 course dinner with a white bottle of Austrian grauburgunder and a red bottle of German riesling The first course was a tartar of dorade. The second course was a bit off target in our opinion. The aspergus are not in season at the time of writing (begin april) and they were a bit hard. The third (main) course was a lamb fillet with a mousse and potato/cheese bites on the side. The meat was okay but nothing too special. The bites with old Rotterdam cheese were very nice and brought something extra to the course. For dessert we had a cheese platter which was good and a panna cotta which wasn’t particularly exciting. All in all the (broad choice of) wine is what makes this restaurant. The food is okay but doesn’t justify the price that is asked.
825,VINEUM,Bartkup,"April 3, 2019",5,"Location just of central station in Rotterdam, these guys are nailing it (killing it as my US buddies would write) in multiple ways; 1) great food (veal, truffle pappardelle) 2) great wine (biggest list of Europe, and 30-40 terrific ones on coravin) at affordable rates 3) Niels and his crew are just splendid
4) great atmosphere, cozy but still private and the place was packed.
Willl come back here time after time. 
Thank you!!"
826,VINEUM,Anzhelika-mcwilliams,"April 2, 2019",4,"Very quiet place , food was normal, but fresh orange juice was sour 🤦‍♀️Asked to change . I can’t recommend this restaurants. For this quality of food prices is too high"
827,VINEUM,dennan2015,"March 22, 2019",4,"We had a lovely 4 course diner. The sommelier was great, shared some nice background of the wines from the wine arrangement. Would highly recommend the restaurant. The starter we had was carpaccio of Gambia’s, second the octopus terrine, I changed to the lambs rack which was super tender, and the cheese platter."
828,VINEUM,Yappuh,"March 6, 2019",5,"Last night we enjoyed a great diner with an absolutely fabulous wine, a Barolo. My UK company loved the wine list and it took some time to make a selection. The overall experience was of such a level we will come back for sure, moreover because the location is not that much ""in your face"" as some other high level restaurants in the city are."
829,VINEUM,169camillaw,"February 3, 2019",5,"We chose the meal with the wine pairings even though I’m usually sceptical about that. However, Vineum have a very passionate and friendly sommelier who made it totally worth it - we loved all his choices as well as his explanations! The food was excellent with sensible portion sizes (especially for the menu). The only disappointment was that my husband ordered the Crepe Suzette at the beginning of the meal and was told after the main course that they had run out."
830,VINEUM,Gideon S,"January 1, 2019",5,"Had dinner here with my wife and friends a few days after a disastrous dinner (see other review about Napoli in Haarlem). We immediately knew we were in for a great night as we were warmly greeted upon entering the restaurant. The dining room upstairs was oozing with a relaxed metropolitan vibe and the waiters were quietly but purposefully moving through the dining room to serve the diners. Drinks orders were quickly taken as menus were handed out for dinner. We all opted for the a la carte menu as the seasonal set menus all revolved around venison steak, something none of us were in the mood for. Across the group, three different four different starters wered ordered: (1) the steak tartare which was delicious; (2) the tagliatelle with fresh truffle which had an amazing truffle aroma and tasted excellent according to my friend; (3) marbré of duck liver which looked amazing and went beautifully with the pata negra ham; (4) pan-fried duck liver with pear tarte tatin and an ice wine reduction - simply amazing! For mains, four of us ordered the grilled beef tenderloin, two of which also ordered the supplementary pan-friend duck liver. One of us ordered the Corvina (fish) fillet. All five mains were outstanding in taste and presentation. The portion sizes were also just right. Besides the food, we ordered three bottles of 2012 Chassagne-Montrachet which accompanied the meal beautifully. All in all, Vineum was a great new discovery in Rotterdam and a place I will definitely visit again when in Rotterdam as the restaurant combines great food, a good wine list and friendly and proficient service."
831,VINEUM,Ton S,"November 12, 2018",5,Vineum works from the wine to a meal. I was there for my birthday with family and friends. Vineum has a private dining room for this kind of occasions. Wine and Food are really great

865,De Kleine Ondeugd,Wang912,"December 17, 2019",1,"I appreciate that I am informed that there is only a fixed menu when I got in. However, I would be even more appreciated if 1. I am informed that the main course is spicy, when I ask whether any dish in the set is spicy when I was ordering. The answer I got is ""not spicy at all"". But two of the four small dishes in the main course has the word ""spicy"" in its later description. 
2. I am informed that the visa card is not accepted in this restaurant. Indeed, no major card, probably beside the local card is accepted. 

Regarding the other information that might be useful, tap water is not provided. I would say the price is two times higher compared to the food quality. Also, when I compained that the food, that was described as not spicy, is a bit spicy, the waitress simply walked away.

I suggest thinking twice before going to this place."
866,De Kleine Ondeugd,HansCB,"October 22, 2019",5,"This restaurant hasn't got a menu with choices of dishes, you just get either three or four courses with a variety of small dishes accompanies by rice, nasi or padthai.

898,Sugo Westblaak,dallevino,"September 13, 2021",1,"The unsympathetic attitude of the oldest employer, most probably the boss is unaccettable when you work in contact with people. Totally uncare and listless. We won't come back."
899,Sugo Westblaak,AJTheBuilder,"July 27, 2021",1,"Does good service sound like a 1 hour 45 minutes wait for two pizzas? If you agree that this is ok you will love it! Alternatively if you value your time and expect your pizza to be as described on the menu, perhaps this is not the Pizzeria for you. Size by the way also matters (smaller than described) - but this will be for you to find out if you make the mistake of not reading this review!"

901,Sugo Westblaak,Go732382,"February 28, 2020",3,"We really loved this place. The pizza had a very good amount and quality of toppings. This year they changed the toppings and it is not what it was used to be. The toppings are mostly spreads with some minor veggies and there is not so much variety in tastes anymore. everything is pretty much the same. Please bring Bach the caramalised union, bresola, ham with artisjok, mixed champi's and grilled veggies!! We do not visit this place that often anymore (used to be each week visit or take away)."
902,Sugo Westblaak,PalliiR,"October 30, 2019",5,"Really enjoyed our trip to this restaurant. Service was incredibly helpful and friendly. Good mix of families, couples and groups. Interesting range of toppings on a different kind of pizza base - delicious change."

906,Sugo Westblaak,MrsPiket,"December 3, 2018",4,"Sugo Pizza is a pleasant no-nonsense restaurant located in the centre of Rotterdam. Actually it is a traiteur-pizzeria offering tasty pizzas in snack format. Service is adequate and friendly. The pizzas you chose from the counter are shortly re-baked in the oven and cut in eatable size before serving. You have a large choice of good looking fresh pizzas.

We came on a Sunday for lunch and the place was rather busy, a good sign. We went for different pizzas, San Pellegrino &amp; cappuccino and we were not disappointed. The snacks were tasty and the coffee was good.

Sugo is a good place for snack-pizzas at a reasonable price. Recommended."
907,Sugo Westblaak,Nelson J,"November 6, 2018",4,"Traveled with a large group and pre-arranged an amazing dinner at SUGO for nearly 40 high school musicians and chaperons. The meal was perfect for our group of diverse eaters, everything from veggie options to total carnivore. The display cases highlighted an amazing array of fresh-made in-house pizzas that pay homage to the bakery in the crust. We were up a set up steep stairs to the mezzanine level and received excellent and ever-present service. Pizzas come on a large wooden board and we just shared everything. It was fun, intimate and the desserts are worth saving room for. Staff was fun and very friendly. Since we were such a large group we essentially bought out the upper floor. I think if it were busy and you were a smaller party your experience would perhaps be different. I'd certainly consider returning next time I'm in Rotterdam as the food was terrific and the price point totally reasonable for Northern Europe."

978,Lot & Daan,bunnyofdarkness,"August 17, 2020",3,"Stopped in for breakfast as it was near our hotel. One of us had a tasty cheese, apple and pesto sandwich, however the large pancake stack the other had was a bit disappointing. Chai latte was very nice and coffee was ok (very strong)."
979,Lot & Daan,sydney t,"August 16, 2020",1,"CHANGED FOR THE WORST. TERRIBLE! We were regulars here every Sunday. We hadn’t been since corona, and we went today for the first time. The menu has changed drastically. They had no English menus to start, no oat milk, no orange juice or juice of the day. I ordered the Houthakkersbrood met in Bourbon gegrilde kip, it came out with two sad, dry looking pieces of chicken thigh, with pickles on top and a tiny bit of cucumber and arugula. The chicken tasted as terrible as it looked. I didn’t eat my meal at all, I had two bites and put it aside. I told the waitress that it was dry and not nice and she said she would tell the kitchen but never came back with a solution. It sat on our table for 20 more minutes until my boyfriend went in and paid the bill and they charged us full price. I ate a couple of vegan bitterballs and left hungry. What a shame this restaurant went down hill. I don’t know if it’s because of the coronavirus or because the owners changed but something definitely went wrong. They took away everything good on the menu and replaced it with sad meals. We drove all the way from Zwijndrecht for this restaurant like we did for almost a year and to say the least they have lost loyal customers. I would suggest to anyone else who would like to dine here to save themselves the disappointment and go to 30MLs in Rotterdam Zuid or centraal. Below is my original review in 2019. 

ORIGINAL POST 2019: Amazing food, reasonable prices!! This is my new favourite spot. I think we are making it a mandatory Sunday brunch! Very very fresh food, makes me feel like I am in an Australian cafe again. The juice of the day is my favourite part. Thank you Lot &amp; Daan!"
980,Lot & Daan,travel_with_kimberly,"July 21, 2020",5,"Last Thursday I had an amazing dinner at LOT & DAAN! They have a very cool concept, you can unlimited choose different dishes from their delicious menu and share them with you friends and family! My favorite dishes were the portobello and goatcheese dishes. And not to forget the yummie desserts! When you are on staycation in Rotterdam, you should visit this restaurant which lies in the center of Rotterdam near the area called “The old harbour”. I certainly come back to try their breakfast or lunch!"
981,Lot & Daan,dennan2015,"March 13, 2020",4,"Very nice place, and lovely diner. Loved the food sharing idea like tapas. Different dishes than a regular spanish tapas. Loved all dishes. Waiters were very friendly."

All in all we jade a really lovely stay. I’m definitely visiting another time."
985,Lot & Daan,525parisr,"February 1, 2020",1,"First of all the menu for the brunch is very limited. There are very few options of dishes with eggs and only one option for juice. We order an omelette, one more dish with eggs and the pancakes. The food arrived in almost 40 min. The dishes with the eggs were poorly made, with combinations that did not make any sense. And now we come to the pancakes. The dish had 3 pancakes, the top side of all of them was definitely overcooked but as we were eating and we got to the middle one we saw that it's bottom side was black. You can clearly see why it was ""hidden"" in the middle..."

Tasty breakfast but wouldn't hurry back."
987,Lot & Daan,RATSOMATIC,"December 28, 2019",4,Stopped here for breakfast before a walking tour. Pleasant surroundings and friendly staff. Lots of veggie and vegan options.

1024,The India Paradise,Komorow,"November 4, 2018",5,"The food was delicous and indian like spicy. But you can order it in mild or spicy so thats not a problem. It’s a great restaurant run by a Sikh family. Thanks for the evening, Satnam"

1026,The India Paradise,fredr138,"September 8, 2018",5,"Always absolut best taste in Indian dishes! Be careful not to choose ""spicey"" taste if you're not sure. You can order any dish in medium or mild. Every time we come here the restaurant looks better and the service from the owner and two ladies is always perfect. They make you feel like a friend instead of a customer.
A ""must-do"" for everyone visiting Rotterdam and likes Indian food."
1027,The India Paradise,mtanbrainz,"April 30, 2018",5,Great lady hostess! That's how you customer service. Food is great but the vindaloo could be much spicier. Good for people who don't take their food too spicy.

1082,Pho Vietnamese Restaurant,danzzzilla,"October 6, 2019",3,"Pho with beef was pretty tasteless, vegetables were not fresh.. that was really sad to see. If they think it’s normal service.. I tried decent pho soup in other places. In this place - the pho was pretty mediocre. Bahn mi was tasteless as well. Sadly."
1083,Pho Vietnamese Restaurant,Crystalism,"April 22, 2019",2,"No good pho - unfresh and undercooked noodles, good quality beef and that's pretty much it. Spring rolls were okay, but why would I go to this place just to eat spring rolls anyway. But again I’m not rating one because the spring rolls are edible. 

Got cheated by the outlook of the the restaurant that serves below average food run by people who couldn't care less.

Can’t believe people actually recommend their pho - better off eating instant noodles and add your own beef.

Please also do yourself a favour by counting your change as they have the tendency to return the wrong amount."
1084,Pho Vietnamese Restaurant,Iv0nne_K868,"March 9, 2019",3,"I had the lemongrass chicken. It came very fast to the table, for my taste too fast and to my big disappointment was the taste beautiful but neither meat nor rice hot, just warm. Plates were not heated as they should be in any professional and good restaurant. When I told the waitress it wasn't hot, she took it back to the kitchen. I got a new plate and this time it was more hot but no lemon grass flavour anymore. Still very edible, but a big disappointment. Also I found the quality of the meat very poor. If the restaurant can work on these things, it could be one of the best Asian restaurants soon. Especially as the staff here is super, super nice."

1183,Restaurant Pizzeria Messina,peter_cuijk,1 week ago,5,"Whether from the chart or off the chart, you will be amazed about the taste. The swordfish was fresh and juicy. The salad was served with salami and prosciuto and was more than enough to serve as a whole meal for my wife. The red wine (Montepulciano) that was advised with the salad was delightful.
And there's certainly nothing wrong with the white house wine I had with the fish.
For dessert, I can recommend the Cassata alla Strega.
If you are lucky, you can witness the preparation at the table of a special pasta dish with truffle and Parmesan cheese by the chef.
Dining at Messina's is so much more more than just having a meal."
1184,Restaurant Pizzeria Messina,Luxmako,"September 27, 2020",5,"The most amazing pasta I have had anywhere in the world (and I have been to 40 countries, including Italy)! Highly recommend the house specialty, truffle parmesan pasta, wow! The pizza is excellent too!"

It was indeed a lucky find! From the warm initial greeting by the owner to the friendly staff, it was a lovely experience. 

The food - bass for my wife and veal for me followed by their  “tarta ciocolata” - was excellent. This restaurant is a great place for excellent food and we highly recommend it. 

It’s location - just east of the north end of the Erasmus Bridge and facing the river - is easily accessible."
1187,Restaurant Pizzeria Messina,JBentraveler,"October 4, 2019",5,"We heard Messina was a top shelf Italian restaurant and it was so and more. Gianni the owner was so personable and took such great care in our experience. We turned the meal over to him and he ordered the antipasto Mediterranean to start. It had various cheeses, meats, olives, and egg plant on the tray. We then had the table side truffle pasta which was outstanding. For our entrees we had the seafood risotto, grilled swordfish, and the steamed mussels. Everything was great, but there was a huge bowl of mussels.
Each entree was cooked perfectly and not overly seasoned. We added a couple of bottle of wine and had an excellent dinner. This meal was as if we were in Italy and some of the best food we have ever had anywhere. 
Gianni and all service was excellent."

1191,Restaurant Pizzeria Messina,Graydon W,"April 10, 2019",2,"I was in the city for Rotterdam Marathon and booked here for the Saturday night. Staff/owner were friendly enough but a couple of issues: - we ordered the bread and olives which arrived, and then just a couple of minutes afterward the main meal turned up.  We hadn't finished the starter and the waitress tried to take the food away, even though it had only just been given to us.  We were on a small table so no where near enough room for everything.
- we both ordered the carbonara, but it was really disappointing.  In summary, the eggs were scrambled! 

I can only assume we were being rushed as they were hoping to get another service in, even though we'd prebooked in advance.

Prices was okay, but sadly quality not good enough for us.  Disappointed and I wouldn't come here again."

The Tea Lab is known among the locals for its delicious high tea, but it has more to offer! Different kinds of fresh tea, various coffee variations, wide choice of cakes and smoothie bowls. For example, I chose the berry mango yogurt and fresh mint tea. My friend chose the red velvet pancakes and the funky flamingo tea. And I can say, I can get used to this Sunday breakfast! It was very tasty and we enjoyed the homely atmosphere. Highly recommended for a delicious start to your free Sunday!"

The cakes have been a success for the people that have joined me"

1389,The Tea Lab,185yingyingz,"April 22, 2019",4,Wanted to try this brunch spot for a while. Tried today. I like her detox juice and chicken avocado sandwich. The tosti tasted even better. Latte was a bit milky and light. But that's more personal preference.
1390,The Tea Lab,Amy V,"March 10, 2019",4,Ordered the double espresso with coconut milk. Very tasty! The cafe is a nice place to chill and there's a second floor too. The staff is friendly and there are many options for food and drinks.

1394,The Tea Lab,LauraJane155,"December 11, 2017",4,"We chose the Tea Lab due to their clearly marked vegan options. I had the olive tapenade toastie which was surprisingly good - I don't really know why I chose it as it's usually not my thing at all but I was really pleased with it. I also had the turmeric latte which was nice but the turmeric taste was a bit too strong for me - I think it would be better if you got it without food.

It was really busy and we struggled to find a seat so we were stuck at the top of the stairs with a tiny table which wasn't ideal for eating from but the food and atmosphere were great. Would love to go back and have vegan high tea some time!"

We had no idea this restaurant was so nice. The food was delicious, staff was very kind and helpful. The restaurant is located in a calm and beautiful neighborhood and we think it may be a hidden gem. 

Would definitely come back if we lived in Rotterdam."

1446,De Nieuwe Chinese Muur,asdf55,"April 6, 2018",5,"We had some friends over to Rotterdam for a few days around Easter and we booked the Nieuwe Chinese Muur on the 1st of April. My wife and I know this restaurant very well, we live quite close to it and we often order takeaway meals to be delivered.
The owner/proprietor James Wang welcomed us personally and asked us to wait for a few minutes as the table wasn't quite ready......when he called us to go in we had the BEST table in the restaurant...we had some issues with the menu as there are many set menus, and also tasting menus, all looked great but we couldn't make a choice so Mr. Wang said ...""Leave it to me ...I'll organize a banquet""...AND HE DELIVERED..!!
We had Peking Duck in filo pastry, fried and steamed dimsum....three different courses...softshell crab (magnificent !!!) and two main courses, shrimp and chicken and fillet steak with fried rice and white rice..........The meal was a gastronomic topper and our guests said it was the best Chinese meal they had ever had.
Top marks mr. James Wang...we'll be back !!!"
1447,De Nieuwe Chinese Muur,quickstep09,"October 4, 2017",5,"We arrived late in the evening, but the service and food was still first class. No attempts were made to rush us.

Great service and good value for money! Would love to go back."
1448,De Nieuwe Chinese Muur,raymondh992,"September 10, 2016",5,We love going to this place but this was a special occasion. The owner is a great host and really pampered the birthday guest. 10 out of 10 for both the food and the atmosphere!
1449,De Nieuwe Chinese Muur,606ivarb,"August 13, 2016",5,"Fantastic decorations and atmosphere, we had a spacious room for our birthdays party with the family, group of 18. Food was very good and not the typical Dutch Chinese, more authentic style. We had some vegetarian preferences and they were very flexible in supporting us, we even had a roasted chicken dish which was not on the menus. Food was presented nice and in a timely fashion, despite the many main dishes they came out all together at the same time, dinner table with nice white and very good comfortable chairs, nice plates etc. nice and friendly staff. Recommend the place for just a family dinner or larger groups. We were nicely surprised and this was the first but definitely not the last time we visited them."

1459,Roffa Streetfoodbar,ScratchingTheWorld,"May 1, 2017",5,"We ate here on our first night in Rotterdam. We shared their sausage as an appetizer and both had the Roffa burger, which was excellent. We were seated at the bar, in front of the payment terminal so we were forced to get off our seat when other customers wanted to pay. To compensate the waitress gave us a drink on the house, which was very kind of her. We would recommend this place!

I will never know what it was + would rather not . it would be nice to come across chefs who can cook , have interest in fresh , authentic vegetables and gustatory flair . . . so better finger away !"

He has a lot of passion for what he does and really wants you as a customer to be happy from start to finish. He knows exactly what he is talking about and makes his dishes with the best love. To be 100% honest, I have never eaten gluten-free and vegan food as good as this. The menu is very varied and has dishes for everyone. It's so nice to be able to eat without having to think for a second about what you're eating and just enjoy the delicious food on your plate🤤. Together with the owner, I even got to plan a surprise for my boyfriend's birthday, what a success! He even sang for my boyfriend! This restaurant is definitely my go to. Oh yeah! And don't forget to taste the banana bread, it is crazy delicious."
1478,Happy Food and Health,Niels d,"March 5, 2020",2,"We sat here for a quick lunch, but the service was friendly but really slow. Ordered one of their platters with cold and warm dishes and were not very impressed. Mostly some bread and spreads, barely enough to feed one, let alone two people (for which it was advertised). The food tasted all right, but was way too expensive (26 euros) for what we got. I got the feeling that everything was just overpriced because it was vegan... I must say our host was quite friendly and the restaurant has a nice relaxed atmosphere, but I would not recommend it very much, there are much better options in this neighbourhood."
1479,Happy Food and Health,gemsfh,"February 20, 2020",5,"One of my favourite places in Rotterdam! Its has such a cosy atmosphere and the owners are lovely. I've tried both sweet and salty foods and was never disappointed! As a foodie I have to warn you: the ""save the ocean burger"" is great, their carrot cake and ""cake bars"" are perfectly moist and the Oreo muffins are to die for. I would literally cross town just to eat one! Also their coffee is the best in rotterdam. No joke, there's no comparison.

If you're looking for sustainable clothing, art or objects, they also sell lots of cool items. I really recommend this place for anyone who wants to be healthy or simply eat something yummy. Either way you'll get both 😄"
1480,Happy Food and Health,86ibrahimf,"December 31, 2019",5,"As a meat eater I must say that at this spot, you don’t miss anything! They serve: FOOD! Delicious food. Colorful food. Nothing less nothing more."
1481,Happy Food and Health,Suppersmurf,"December 29, 2019",5,"Our home doesnt look like here, but the owners make you feel like home. They make you feel like you want to move over here. Not just the service, the vibes, but also the food. Omg! 10+"
1482,Happy Food and Health,toogo4,"December 28, 2019",5,"Wow what a place, not that vegan weirdo places but a homely place where you instantly feel at home. The food is so good and honest even for one portion it is no problem for them to exclude a ingredient if you are allergic or don't want it, where do you find this nowadays. The cappuccino, the lovely cakes and their food is awesome. In my short stay in Rotterdam I've been there a couple of times, just for the coffee and for the yummy dinner."
1483,Happy Food and Health,serdart758,"December 26, 2019",5,Very passionate cook and creative menu! I think that the restaurant decoration is giving you full vegan experience in most natural way!
1484,Happy Food and Health,Fatjee,"September 13, 2019",5,"This is by far, the best vegan place we've been to. We really LOVED everything. The owners are very friendly and they make you feel welcome. The food and coffee is absolutely amazing. Highly recommended!!!"
1485,Figaro,erikap902,"June 8, 2019",5,"This is my favorite place to have a nice fresh lunch just as I would have at home (if I have time to prepare me something). I eat here very often, it’s pretty close to my job. So this is a little, cozy, family-owned place, in a very busy commercial street. They will prepare for you sandwiches, omelettes, with fresh ingredients, or you can enjoy the soup of the day. You can choose from the menu but they also prepare something personalized (I might be capricious 🤔). Attention is super, they are friendly and helpful. Prices are low for the standards of the area. You can sit outside if the weather allows it."
1486,Figaro,O2550MQchrisp,"December 15, 2018",5,"Had a delicious omelette breakfast here with my father for only 18 euros (9 per person). The breakfast included coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice. To find a comparable meal nearby would have easily cost double. The server was friendly, attentive, and sociable. Wonderful place that has well earned 5 stars"
1487,Figaro,valeria b,"July 7, 2018",5,"It's a small place in a very commercial street, as soon as I passed in front I saw that something was different there, a lot of local people eating and waiting to eat there when at side you have some of the biggest international food companies.. So we stopped there for a sandwich. My boyfriend has a serious allergy problem; the woman was so kind and  she cared so much about any little details about the allergy like I never saw before, it was incredible; just for her kindness and attention we loved the place ,  then we took 2 sandwiches and the second surprise was the quality of the ingredients, fresh crunchy bread in a lot of different option and fresh ingredients to fill it! The price are very good.
You can see that everything is made with love, please stop there when you go around, you will not get disappointed and thanks again to the wonderful stuff, it's a real pleasure when the service is like that, thanks!!!"
1488,Figaro,BiscuittheBear,"February 6, 2018",5,"We went to this family-owned small and charming place for lunch and ordered sandwiches. You can choose from variety of meats, cheeses, and other different toppings to make your own, unique one. The service is excellent, especially the older lady who is always smiling and accommodating, it gives the place that warm and homely feeling. In addition to sandwiches, they have variety of breakfasts, lunches and croquettes with fries, of course."
1489,Figaro,ras474,"October 2, 2017",5,"I visited this lunchroom for breakfasts during a three day stay in Rotterdam. A wide range of food is offered and the helpful staff were pleased to help me interpret the big (Dutch language)menu and offer suggestions for a different breakfast each day. Good food freshly prepared and served by friendly staff, don't fail to include a visit to the Figaro when next in Rotterdam!"
1490,Figaro,729linar,"March 14, 2017",5,"Figaro is an old family cafeteria in the heart of Rotterdam. From the outside Figaro looks like a little street deli without much more to it than a counter and some tables, but once you enter you will find that the place has soul and is special. The café offers a very friendly family atmosphere(!) and lunch dishes made of delicious quality ingredients. Well-mixed flavours, big portions, reasonable prices, super friendly (English speaking) staff, pastries, wifi and good coffee. I felt taken care of and seen every time I was there. I recommend it especially to travellers searching for the feeling of having a homemade meal away from home."
1491,Figaro,jacopattikawa,"November 14, 2016",5,I'm never dissapointed. The food is always good. I've tried different things and it is all good. The staff is very friendly too 👌✅

1496,Chocolate Company Café Rotterdam,Migotka88,"August 28, 2020",5,"This is one of the first café I have discovered in Rotterdam but definitely still my favorite one. The coffee tastes great, you always get a nice complementary chocolate truffle with it (is there anything better than chocolate and coffee together!? Don't think so! 😅) and the staff is very friendly and quite good with their service! You can get a loyalty card and after 10 stamps get a free coffee and luckily for me they have café also in Delft and Amsterdam so I am always guaranteed a great coffee experience 😊"
1497,Chocolate Company Café Rotterdam,V5451ZXjanel,"October 27, 2019",4,"A great cafe, serving the most fabulous chocolate options! From waffles and chocolate to chocolate spoons in hot milk to the most moist yummy cake! Service efficient and very friendly. Don’t go there if on diet!"
1498,Chocolate Company Café Rotterdam,vroni-lein,"October 6, 2019",5,"Coffee was very good and the cake was so chocolaty it was hard to finish :D The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Nice atmosphere, a bit hipster but not too much. We didn't try the signature hot chocolate but they also have a little gift shop were you can buy nice looking hot-chocolate combos."
1499,Chocolate Company Café Rotterdam,adelouuuuux,"May 16, 2019",5,"I have been already 3 times to this place and every time is a great discovery. If you love chocolate, here is the place to be. You can find chocolate in every forms : beverage, cake, waffle... If you are lucky and have a bit of sun, eating or drinking chocolate based dish on the terrace is very plaisant. The smoothies are also very good. Everyone will find something at his/her taste there."
1500,Chocolate Company Café Rotterdam,Dimitris L,"February 14, 2019",4,"We stumbled across this cafe by chance and went inside. It was mid-morning, so we only had coffee as we did not need to spend time for anything else. The coffee was delicious, probably among the best cups of coffee we had in the previous several weeks of our travels. The cafe also had several other things on offer, such as hot chocolate, cocoa, tea, high tea, salads and delicious sandwiches. The staff were very professional and helpful.  Highly recommended."
1501,Chocolate Company Café Rotterdam,Tinepham,"February 3, 2019",5,Wide range of hot chocolate flavours. Central location Friendly staffs Brunch place as well Nice decorated

1504,Chocolate Company Café Rotterdam,Tinepham,"October 14, 2018",5,"I travelled alone to Rotterdam.

1508,Ciao Ciao,303marnixv,"November 6, 2018",5,Excellent food and service. We had the 4 course surprise menu and it was delicious. Served by friendly Italian employees. Well balanced menu and flavors of outstanding quality. Rotterdam has discovered this as well so we recommend to make reservations. The restaurant has a good atmosphere and it was a pleasure to dine here!
1509,Ciao Ciao,Boerdam,"June 3, 2018",3,"Ok, but 5 years ago it was one of best pizzeria’s in town. Over the top. Too much to choose on the menu, meaning you can not deliver high quality with so many things on your menu. Bad service. Waiting time too long on everything. It used to be a great spot......never again. Sorry."
1510,Ciao Ciao,Jan v,"November 9, 2016",4,If ever you are looking for a really good Italian diner let yourself be surprised at Ciao Ciao. Luciano - the chef - comes from Sicily and cookes with his heart. Call for reservation otherwise you may well be disappointed.
1511,Ciao Ciao,922margau,"May 7, 2016",5,"We love it, they have very nice food with a strong italian influece in both, quality and hospitality. They just opened a nice sunny terrace :) will come again soon."
1512,Ciao Ciao,Gregbruvoor,"April 16, 2016",5,"Sister in law reserved. I did not know this place. Very positively surprised. Great food, very big pizzas for children - better share, nice fish oyster tuna carpaccio mezze as antipasti, sole with asparegus cream and cherry tomatoe pasta as lain dish. No dessert but espresso and home made limoncello along with scropino offered by the owner. What an experience"
1513,Ciao Ciao,Bart R,"March 3, 2016",4,"We, a party of 5, had limited time to eat. We went to Ciao Ciao to have a pizza or a pasta. The place was absolutely buzzing on a Saturday night, but we found a small table to sit and order. I shared plates: a pizza calzone and spaghetti vongole. Both were very good. Especially the spaghetti vongole - it's remarkable how well cooked pasta with a delicious sauce can bring a person genuine happiness. 

Nice and authentic place this restaurant, would love to come back."
1514,Ciao Ciao,640indyl,"February 28, 2016",5,"Fantastic pizzas, and pastas. This restaurant delivers, too. The carbonara is excellent. The formaggi pizza is a favourite, quite powerful blue cheese though"

1516,Ciao Ciao,LOLANetherlands,"January 11, 2013",5,"It is so hard to find an authentic italian restaurant in Rotterdam and since we discovered Ciao Ciao, it has become our favourite restaurant. It is located in Noord, close to where we live and a bit away from the city center, yet reachable by public transport - Tram 8  or 4 stop soetendaalseweg/ train at station Noord. Its a very small restaurant, with a few tables upstairs but they also deliver and offer their whole menu as take away. It is actually 1.5 eur cheaper if you choose the take away option. My favourite is the antipasto platter, always fresh and full of italian delicacies(cold meats, cheese, stuffed peppers and courgettes, sardines, shrimps, meatballs...) but they have countless types of pizza and pasta, meat dishes, calamari... The service is always very friendly and efficient, their kitchen can been seen from the street, which always inspires confidence. Don't hesitate and give it a go, you' ll be hooked on it like we are!"
1517,Burro e Salvia,Migotka88,"August 28, 2020",5,Little place run by friendly Italians from Bologna (the city famous for filled pasta specialty as tortellini and ravioli) where you can eat in or take out homemade fresh pasta 🍝 they also do quite a good pizza! Small menu but great quality and friendly service 👍👌🍕
1518,Burro e Salvia,Pierogita,"July 5, 2020",1,"I ordered a pizza and it arrived very wet and teared into pieces, not eatable at all I called, sent an email with photos and videos but the lady who was handling the complaint just taught me how to cut the pizza #thankyouitchangedmylife Found you on Instagram and wanted to try your pizza for a long time, because you guys look like a small, local authentic restaurant. Faux pas can happen for everyone but you have to learn how to handle your mistakes and customer service"
1519,Burro e Salvia,Maraffler,"October 7, 2019",1,"If you don't criticize the food, the restaurant is a good choice. A friend of mine did and left the restaurant with tears in her eyes. After a long and strenuous walk through Rotterdam, my friends and I were very hungry and decided to eat at burro e salvia. We asked the waiter if there was a table for four. He immediately denied. A couple at a table for four person offered us their table and sat down at a free table for two people. A simple solution, which the waiter did not even consider. A few minutes later a family of five came, for which the waiter simply put together two tables. As we sat down, the waiter handed us only one small menu card and warned us that the meal could take over 30 minutes. We ordered two pizzas and two noodle dishes. We waited over 40 minutes. During this time the sun set and it became very cold outside, however, blankets or something similar were not offered to us. Even the family of five who sat in the warmth got the food earlier than we did. When our meal was finally ready we had to realize that the noodles were too hard (and we know what al dente means). And although my friend  was really hungry and had to wait a long time for the food, she decided to return the pasta dishes. The waiter reacted very unfriendly and said that the noodles must be like that and that they are the Italian experts and not us. He offered to make new noodles, but assured us that they would taste the same and it would take another 30 minutes. My friend denied and we shared the two pizzas, which we could not really enjoy because of that unlucky situation. We didn't feel very welcome before. But after we gave the food back, we were literally ignored. No excuse, no attention, we weren't even asked if we wanted another drink or if the pizza tasted good. After we ate, we wanted to pay and were surprised that we should pay for the two pasta as well. We were confused and shocked. So we should pay for too hard noodles that we did not like and, above all, did not eat. When we refused, we were insulted furiously. Supposedly we are disrespectful and have no idea of Italian food. We were asked where we came from and when we said that we were from Germany, they replied to us ""typical Germans"". My friend tried to explain to the waiter in peace why we did not want to pay for it but we were constantly interrupted and the waiter became very loud and unfriendly. My friend felt unfairly treated and felt very pressed and forced to pay the amount. Only when the cook came out of the kitchen and said that we didn't need to pay for the pasta, we could go. When we left, the waitress yelled something in our direction, which we did not understand. I guess it wasn't anything nice. I also assume that we would have had to pay for the second pasta in addition to the first try . All in all, it was a very catastrophic experience like I have never experienced before. Normally I rarely write reviews but my friends and I think it is important that you as a customer should not put up with everything."
1520,Burro e Salvia,David G,"August 26, 2019",5,"This is the best Italian food I have had, outside of Italy. The ingredients are delicious, and the love and care that goes into the many preparation steps is amazing. Also, it's incredibly good value. This restaurant deserves to be super successful!"
1521,Burro e Salvia,Fien H,"May 5, 2019",4,"This place deserves more credit. And more customers. Absolute fab cooking, But compared to last year, they seemed to have lost their touch or energy. And so it's now basic, but still the best pizza's. Before you could buy fresh pasta's to take home, it was more varied. It's mot easy with another full Italian restaurant next door, and a pizza outlet in the Fenix.
In the summer, there are about six tabels. It's small, mostly take out."
1522,Burro e Salvia,Diego C,"April 21, 2019",5,"Coming in Rotterdam for a trip from Luxembourg, it’s the best Italian authentic restaurant in Benelux region."
1523,Burro e Salvia,justinlY9538KA,"April 12, 2019",5,"Small restaurant in a trendy area of Rotterdam serving traditional Italian food. Service is excellent, the food is incredibly fresh and the ingredients are specially selected. The pizza base with three sorts of flour is delicious before any topping is added! Friendly service and the best Italian food in Rottetdam - what's not to like?
Second visit in two weeks!"
1524,Burro e Salvia,sjgbaar,"February 14, 2019",5,"My (Italian) friend and I live in Rotterdam and have been on the look out for new spots. Despite finding some good Italian options in the city, it has been impossible to find a fresh pasta place. Without any assumptions we ventured to Deliplein to try Burro e Salvia. Hands down, this place has been our best Italian experience yet. We ordered the mushroom ravioli, tagliatelle with bolognese and a tortelloni with goat cheese. All, handmade and deliciously flavoured.

All dishes are prepared fresh, with imported ingredients from Italy. Prices are reasonable, interior is modest. They do not serve alcohol (yet), but with pasta this great, you won't care. With the recent developments in that part of the city, we're already afraid that in a fe months time it will be difficult to get a table at Burro e Salvia. Get it while its hot!"
1525,Burro e Salvia,SimonW4496,"December 8, 2018",5,"Good food, good price, friendly service... Many people order food from here, yet the restaurant is a nice place too. Very calm atmosphere. I highly recommend dinner here after a busy daytrip."
1526,Burro e Salvia,DerHenni,"September 30, 2017",5,"The restaurant is small so there are not many tables, but the food here is great! The pasta is fresh and self-made, the sauces are really delicious and together it is just a perfect experience of Italian food! The staff is friendly and helpful, the prices are really fair and the food quality is high. Had two main pasta dishes and a big bottle of water for less than 20 EUR. There's something for everyone: meat lovers, vegetarians and vegan dishes as well.
If you can't get a seat, they also deliver, or you can get your food for take away. But bring cash if you don't have a Dutch bank card, as they accept no international credit or debit cards.
We had a great lunch here and can strongly recommend this place to anyone craving for some genuine Italian food!"

Love the beef stew fries and the bittenballen. It’s perfect for lunch! The only down side is I m too short to sit on the bar but that’s on my gene not the restaurant. Would come again to chill, maybe next time I will get a smoothie during summer time!"

Due to the CORONA measures, only tables were available behind the store. We were invited to the garden behind the store and passed an extensive range of delicacies.
The garden was a small but pleasant place for lunch. In this case, we had a simple lunch including pommodore soup and pastel de nata. The tasty cappuccino was repeated.
The host and lady made the short stay very enjoyable.

First I got ignored by the lady/lunch cook waiting at the counter to order my lunch than some one else came in and stood next to me she apologized to him that it is so busy and it is gonna take a while for the food to order and still ignoring me she was making a salad for a guest with some
creamy sauce/dip and wiped the sauce off with her finger twice. What happened to HHCP I would say. Obviously not prepared for ""a busy day"". Kitchen (food part) exploded just 6 tickets hanging there to be made, barista cranking up coffee left and right and dirty tables.

Her colleague stepped in and ask me if I being helped. I told her not really.  Ordered a slice of bread with chicken and pesto.
First bite strong bitter taste and quickly discovered it was the pesto. Took a few more bites just to make sure. Luckily being a chef stuff like this is quickly detected and my guy feelings were right.
Told the waitress (who also helped me) and she correctly handled it got us 2 new ones 👌🏽. 
Every chef tastes his or her food before you start your shift. 

I rate it average.
no more scones at 13:00
service being mwah
their being so unprepared for such a big day for Rotterdam."

Whether it is for a normal night out and having a few drinks, having a great meal served up by the chefs, watching formula 1/soccer or having a private party…they offer it all! The service by the entire team is sublime and you can really see that they love their work. The menu isn’t the largest that you’ll find, but what they put on their is amazing! The fish and chips are by far the best in Rotterdam, the filet steak (which they offer besides their menu as a special) with pepper/truffle sauce is amazing and their ‘borrelplank’ offers a wide range of fresh products. I will always recommend this place to anyone! Thanks Cor and team!"

Here the idea of how post-war Central Europe should be constituted, was firstly formed.

For the main course, we had the special Panzerotto Speciale and Tonno 🐟Subito with smoked tuna carpaccio. My favorite dish for the dinner goes to the Panzerotto, this is the typical street food in Puglia, you really taste the crispy and crunchy skin of Panzerotto. 😊

A must try dessert 🥮at Panzero Italian restaurant is the Pistachio Lava Cake, OMG this is so yummy and a perfect ending after all the amazing Italian dishes that we had.

I booked a table for 20:00 for the Saturday evening and it did not disappoint.

Service: 
The staff here are so friendly and welcoming and really explain the menu to you and actually come across that they are proud to work there and have passion for the job. 

Food:
5*5*5* all the way. I have lived in NRW Deutschland for 4 years and struggle to find a decent steak in a great atmosphere. Well The Meat Club certainly delivered on their restaurant name. Beautifully presented MR ribeye and sirloin on a board with a side salad and some home made chips, we added a pepper sauce. This was literally the highlight of my trip. I was in a steak lovers heaven with a large Malbec to wash it down. We decided to also order deserts and they were so tasty, 1 Creme Brûlée with a cherry sorbet and 1 chocolate cookie cake with a scoop of great quality vanilla ice cream. 

What we had: 
1x bottle Sauvignon 
1x glass Malbec 
1x Ribeye 
1x Sirloin
Chips 
Side salad
Creme brûlée 
Chocolate cookie cake 
1x glass Sauvignon 
1x double espresso 

Total €120.00
The easiest money I’ve ever spent on food."

You just got a new loyal costumer."
1966,The Meatclub,Magda B,"October 20, 2020",4,"The whole experience was mostly great! If you're looking to eat only meat - it's great! The starters are pretty big, the steaks cooked very well and the wine selection was very good! The only two things that bothered us that even though covid-19 restrictions were stated by the government and at first view the restaurant followed them, the waitress was coming very close to each table she was helping without any mask/hand cleaning/etc. that we saw in other places. And one of the starters was not great.
But overall we were happy when leaving."
1967,The Meatclub,Katherine I,"October 14, 2020",5,"I took the kids, who are studying at the local uni. We hadn't really intended to eat at such a nice place. Literally, we thought it was going to be a MacDonalds type place. So glad it wasn't. Pricey but worth every mouthful. We also had a lovely waiter who spoke with passion about the food and about the restaurant. The kids and I really appreciated that, it made it more authentic and personal."
1968,The Meatclub,BrummyTraveller,"August 13, 2020",5,"We have just finished the most amazing meal here. However it’s more like a culinary experience. The staff are so knowledgeable about the meat and it’s Uruguayan origins and are passionate about sharing this with their guests. Giovanny, our waiter this evening, made our visit extra special. He was extremely attentive, knowledgeable and kind. 
He advised us on the wine to accompany the chefs 3 cuts choice. We were able to sample the two wines we had narrowed down and enjoyed doing a blind taste test!
The meat was just wow!!!!! My husband. Nd I high said that we will never forget the taste of the meat. Incredible! 
The sides that accompany the meat were also cooked to perfection.
If you love your red meat and enjoy a culinary experience then this is the place to go.
We cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough. 
Keep up the good work!"

1970,The Meatclub,bunnyofdarkness,"May 14, 2020",5,"We were really really lucky to get a table for dinner on the first night of our stay in Rotterdam. The place was very busy, despite being a week night and it is relatively small so we would suggest booking to make sure you aren't disappointed. The staff were very friendly and efficient. We were sat at a table which looked into the kitchen, this kept us well entertained during our meal and it was nice to see all the food being prepared. The quality of the meat was excellent, really excellent. We had the platter of meat in which the chef chooses 3 cuts for you and a side of skinny fries between us. The meat was beautifully cooked, seasoned and served relatively plain which meant you could really appreciate the flavour. It almost melt in your mouth and entirely worth the money we handed over at the end of the meal. If you like steak you need to try here."

The service is superfriendly - as a surprise, they brought me a little birthday cake accompanied by a nice birthday song! The atmosphere is great as well, cozy and modern. 10/10 would recommend!"
2012,Atithi Indian Restaurant Rotterdam,Torquin01,4 weeks ago,3,"After reading the excellent reviews here on Tripadvisor, my wife booked this restaurant for a special occasion on a Saturday night at 19.30 hrs. After we stood in line outside, waiting to be seated, we were led to a table where we were provided only the drinks menu. Looking around, the place was packed with people looking at empty plates. After half an hour(!) we were asked if we wanted to order drinks and food. After that, we had to wait another HOUR just for our appetizers, without even a basket of Papadums to keep us from getting too hungry. When I made a remark to the waiter about it, he apologized by saying that it is very busy during weekends. That, however, should not be a legitimate reason for not even asking for drinks when customers are shown their table. He did apologize several times more, but did not check during the main course if everything was still satisfactory. Also, he could have offered us our coffes for free - which could have been an opportunity to set the bad service straight. By the way, I noticed that the waitresses were really slow and working inefficiently, so the delays should really not only be blamed on the kitchen. However, I must admit that the Chicken Tikka Masala was really good, and so were the vegetable dish and the Naan breads we ordered (the Samosa was too saucy to be enjoyed we felt). And the chairs in fhe restaurant are really comfortable. All in all, I can advise the restaurant for its food - just don’t go there during the weekend."
2013,Atithi Indian Restaurant Rotterdam,irfansherazi,5 weeks ago,5,"We had Dinner at Atithi and were very pleased with what we got at the cost range we paid.

2017,Atithi Indian Restaurant Rotterdam,N1273VXrajeshm,"August 23, 2021",4,"Yesterday me and my 86 year old mother had to be in Rotterdam for some work and decided to drop by for a quick Indian meal before heading back to Eindhoven as it was already past 8 pm. The restaurant was chock-full yet we were given a table by Hari and despite his claims that we had to expect a long waiting time, we were served our food within 20 min. I strongly recommend the Malai Kofta and Palak Paneer which were mild, not too spicy, somewhat sweet but delicioussssssssssssss. To be eaten with rice AND butter naan. It is somewhat pricy as we paid EUR 55 for 2 main dishes, 1 soup, 2 drinks and the same meal in Eindhoven would cost EUR 35-40 but then again, Nieuwe Werk is an expensive neighbourhood in Rotterdam. Overall, a very nice experience with friendly staff and delicious food...given the fact that me and mom are Indian. Well done."

2185,Gastrobar Hartig,marjaanak2014,"August 7, 2021",2,"A visit to the restaurant was disappointing. We chose the Restaurant based on Tripadvisor’s recommendations, but were disappointed. The staff were friendly but they wera busy. The food was ok, but I wonder why the starter main course and dessert were brought to the table at different times. For example, one got their main course 10-15 minutes before the others. There were a long blond hair in a starter.

It was difficult to pay the bill. I had to try three different credit cards that were not accepted by the machine (embarrassing). Changing the machine helped.

I am most disappointed with this. I made a table reservation in time and wrote:

""Some wishies: we are from Finland and my son is moving to Rotterdam to study. This is our first Time in Rotterdam. He has also his 19th birthday. Can you note that Somehow, please 😄""

The restaurant replied, ""Thank you for your reservation. We notice it in our agenda.""

Nothing happened. I could have paid for the candle."

The food was very sophisticated & tasty and the wines were even better. Service is friendly and professional. The decor of this place is very modern but warm and there is a good level of privacy (space inbetween the tables).
2319,Restaurant Fitzgerald,Wilfried W,"August 28, 2019",4,"First class star-rated restaurant in a modern setting of glass and stone. With groups of 5 and over no à la carte dining but menus for the entire group. Prices are high, especially most of the wines, with an overwhelming choice at the high to very high price level.
The food was very tasteful, the service fine and friendly, the surroundings too noisy after a large group entered and took place in a separate part of the room behind us. We had to close the doors because of the noise. 
I prefer simpler restaurants with simpler offerings but if you want to splash out in Rotterdam you won’t be disappointed at the Fitzgerald."
2320,Restaurant Fitzgerald,divenuts,"August 8, 2019",5,"We enjoyed a lovely evening at Fitzgeralds. The food , wine and service were all excellent.

In addition there were multiple amuse's served and we thoroughly enjoyed the wine pairing which included several wines we would have never thought of trying.
The staff were pleasant and efficient, the surroundings comfortable: all in all a perfect evening.
Highly recommended."
2321,Restaurant Fitzgerald,mschr,"July 19, 2019",5,"I had a really, really good meal and will definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a superior meal. The service is very forthcoming, yet super professional. A great feature is that you can do from 3-7 courses of the tasting menu. Every course incl appetizers was an elegant dish using  first-class ingredients and super condensed flavors. The only hiccup being that flavors were sometimes overdone. As for wine I was positively impressed with the by-the-glass selection; very good producers. All in all a thoroughly great experience."

For Gem bless her she couldn’t manage it all and she usually likes a good stuffing

2402,Guliano,JamesCassandra,"November 6, 2019",5,"I loved this place!!!! It reminded me of a few places in Manhattan. It’s a very down to earth, relaxing and “I’m in my living room at home” style. Once you arrive you have to wait to be seated. The staff welcome was lovely and cheerful. Once being seated we were presented with the menus and offered to drink. The way it was done was so relaxed and comfortable as if you were home. You could tell all staff members were totally in sync and were a true team. Every person that came to our table after that was open, welcoming and kept on cracking jokes which was lots of fun! 

Then comes the food... the food is amazing!!! They are specialized in sandwiches and they are great! There are great choices (too many to make a decision right away... it took me 20mins) and once you have made your choice you do not regret it. It was fresh, plentiful and the flavors all mixed well together. To be honest I really wanted to get a second one but was too full. 

Thank you all for your exceptional hospitality :) 

PS: Keep in mind this place is very popular so you may have to wait a little while to be seated. If that is the case, please do wait, it is totally worth it!"

2500,Zeezout,Finedininglady,"August 18, 2021",5,"Perhaps somewhat prejudiced I went to eat at restaurant Zeezout. With Patron Cuisinier Patrick ‘ t Hart i already had some nice conversations online about his just achieved star, the overwhelming reactions that came along with it, the corona crisis and what that crisis did to him and his family. My promise to him was that I would join him for lunch as soon as possible after the corona measurements went down, and so it happened.

Zeezout, located in the Scheepvaartkwartier in Rotterdam, has been in existence since 1998, Patrick is in charge there, but his wife Anet and his daughters can also be found in the restaurant. The interior is relax but elegant in which the beautifully inlaid shell tables stand out.

The menu is small with only some choices in oysters, 3 starters, 3 main courses and 3 desserts but literally everything is appealing. We order our picks and can’t wait to start our feast.

* look at the pictures for the food story or look either on instagram or my website*

Patrick, thank you for everything, you are one of the first restaurants I recommend in the Rotterdam area. no nonsense, just great food! I will definitely come back for a nice evening at your lovely restaurant."

So the best thing in the world is to be pleasantly surprised by food served that tastes beyond your (home) imagination. Zeezout is one of these fish restaurants.

2659,Kwiezien,X5265MZmaryw,"August 27, 2021",5,"I loved the concept of this restaurant. The menu offers 3,4 and 5 course dinners with complete flexibility. You can choose courses from any category. So you could pick 2 appetizers, a main and a dessert or 3 desserts. Every dish was beautiful and delicious. The owner/chef was moving about the restaurant advising customers with his knowledge,patience and sense of humor. We felt like we were guests in his home. Our personable sommelier, Jill, knew her wines. We were also fortunate to purchase a bottle of her wonderful “Lemonjillo” conceived during the pandemic shutdown. This restaurant has Michelin star quality food served with fun in an unpretentious atmosphere.  Highly recommend when in Rotterdam."
2660,Kwiezien,GerbenS1969,"January 26, 2019",4,"We visited Kwiezien a couple of weeks ago. It is located in Katendrecht which has become really trendy lately. There was a slight mistake with the reservation, so we had to wait 30 mins but that was handled nicely by giving us a course for free in the pub where we waited. You can take a 3, 4 or 5 couse menu and then you have the choice between 16 different courses. You can pick and choose any of them. Nice selection, fish and meat and vegan if that is your thing. Food was delicious, but I was a bit disappointed with the wines they served with each course. I think they were not really outstanding. Sevice was good, real informal Rotterdam style. I think a 4 course menu is around EUR 40, and accompaning wines EUR 30, but I would choose half glasses for EUR 15 approximately, as you get enough with that arrangement :)"
2661,Kwiezien,SanThom2000,"July 15, 2018",4,"We had a dinner on a Friday night at Kwiezien and opted for the chef’s table. The whole night we had a very nice interaction with one of the chefs, Dennis, who gave us a great insight in the way the kitchen is run. We went for the 4 course menu with wine pairing. Overall the food was good, even though there were some inconsistencies in the quality of every course. Outstanding were the crispy spare ribs. We had a fun evening at Kwiezien."
2662,Kwiezien,benlengyel,"June 16, 2018",5,"I have been out to many restaurants in the Netherlands and I think this is the best one I have been to. The dishes were full of flavour and I just enjoyed every mouth full. The staff were amazing and always happy to help or to answer any questions we had.

The 2 chefs were very chatty, very warm and inviting.

The wine selection was outstanding and it matched the dishes we had.

My wife and i will be going back for sure.

Thanks for putting us at the chefs table.

2663,Kwiezien,AndersUA,"June 12, 2018",5,"Very friendly service, they offer a smaller portions for 3-6 dishes and you can combine whatever you like. Food is very good and location is quite nice"
2664,Kwiezien,geertruida2018,"February 22, 2018",5,"It isn't just eating, it is an experience. Reservations are needed. We also love the location. Had some beer in the micro brewery near by, before we went."
2665,Kwiezien,JoiadeJong,"January 2, 2018",5,"Kwiezien was a very pleasant birthday surprise in which my taste buds got a very new experience and that after 23 years! My concern with cuisine is always the portions, but after this lovely night I was more than full. Every meal was another adventure, one more tasteful than the other. The location is quite small, which gives Kwiezien a very intimate atmosphere. And well the service is simply excellent. 

I would especially recommend Kwiezien for special occassions. Although, it is definitely worth the pricetag, it should be said that it is more expensive than regular restaurants. For young people like me that makes it harder to visit often."
2666,Kwiezien,gurt65,"December 1, 2017",5,"Kwiezien is crowded on a Thursday night in november. Car parking was not a problem in the neighborhood. Remember, on the way to the parkingmeter (sometimes quite a walk) your registration number because that is what you need! At arrival we were friendly welcomed with a Rotterdam accent. We could – if desired – take a seat at the Chef's Table. We didn't know what that meant to be honest, but we agreed. We got 2 places allocated to the worksheet of the 2 chefs.
We could chat and ask every question we’d liked. The Chef was friendly and the talks were personal too. Not the obligatory things. Very nice!
At Kwiezien you choose a number (3,4,or 5) of courses -menu and then make your choice from menu.
We went for the 4 course menu and it turned out a perfect choice. You also can choose for a half-wine package. 
You drink different wines per dish and will not leave the restaurant with a headache. Good concept!
For the wine lover: the owner has her Master of Wine, so the wine is in very good hands in this restaurant. 
The food: you must discover it, because a journey it is. Delicious on taste, surprising choices and beautiful plates and bowls. In the meantime the chef told us what he was doing and also that Kwiezien has very close-knit team that cooperates fir years. That’s  a good sign. 
Chef's Table means, that as an extra between dishes, you’ll get a small example of the other dishes on the menu.
So we received 4 courses of our ordered menu and in between  3 small snacks (including the famous croquette of the house) from the other dishes.
Everything was equally delicious and original! 
Staf’s timing and friendliness is super. 
Kwiezien is a real winner!!!
(FYI: there is also a disabled toilet)."
2667,Kwiezien,808MarkP808,"November 8, 2017",5,"Booked to go on a Saturday evening. It was busy (full), but we got our table on time. The service was excellent. The staff were friendly. The food was really good. We had the 9 dish option, and that was more than enough... The wine list is limited, but it is reasonable value.  Will definitely go back!!"
2668,Kwiezien,turbodelia,"October 26, 2017",5,"What a nice surprise! Didn't know Kwiezien till we attended a business dinner. We chose the tapas experience, 9 beautiful dishes chosen by the chef. Pretty skeptical about the quantity and the food at first, till service started. One after the other beautiful and original dishes, served by a very professional staff. Impressive also how - however a pretty small place - the kitchen is so well organized that 22 people got served at the same time with no accidents. Great success"

2719,Restaurant Langoest,Caziah G,"August 1, 2021",5,I visited this restaurant in a moment of distress and deserved a treat. I live above the restaurant and have never been inside. The staff were accommodating and had knowledge of good wines and pairing sides with mains. I started with the oyster mix . FANTASTIC! Then the mussels ( these were not on the menu) FANTASTIC! Paired with the bread and thick chips. It was a great experience. I had no phone so it was me and my thoughts and good food and wine. I’d definitely return here. Pricey but worth every penny .. Cent !
2720,Restaurant Langoest,Magda B,"October 20, 2020",5,"I do not understand why the Langoest restaurant has so little reviews! The place is amazing! The food, the service, the view, the decor, was just perfect! My fiancee took me there for our anniversary dinner and at the beginning I was disappointed that we did not manage to get a table at a ""fancy"" restaurant, the moment we arrived, we were welcomed and then served the food.. all the disappointment went away in full! The octopus starter was the best octopus dish I have ever had (comparing to fine dining in Barcelona, restaurants in Greece, etc.), it's definitely a must try! Then we had the sea food mixed plater and it was just fantastic! Together with the soave wine it was just an amazing meal in a great atmosphere! Thank you!"

2724,Restaurant Langoest,Vicky V,"November 19, 2019",4,"We enjoyed an evening in this classy restaurant. The menu is based on classic cuisine, but with contemporary touches. We took the risk of the surprise menu, starting with nice bowl of sashimi of tuna and salmon, oyster and wakame, main course was the sea bass in salt crust, which we can only recommend!  For dessert there was a small but nice plate.  The price for this full menu was only 37 euro."
2725,Restaurant Langoest,liverpool1023,"November 16, 2019",5,"With a great view towards the Erasmus bridge this restaurant oozes style. The menu is relatively pared-down example of classic seafood dishes. For the starter I opted for the lobster bisque spiked with cognac. This was suitably rich and delicious. My main was halibut with eel sauce including brown shrimps. This was a lovely dish of food. 

My other half opted for the slightly more theatrical salt baked sea bass. The salt was expertly bashed with a small metal mallet and the fish prepared at the table. The result was purred over with enjoyment. 

Service is very friendly and attentive. The wine list is extensive and we were pleased with our choice of an Albariño."
2726,Restaurant Langoest,teppy83,"October 28, 2019",5,This is by far and away the best fish restaurant in Rotterdam.

The staff also strike the perfect balance between attentive and discreet.
2727,Restaurant Langoest,SeanA756,"October 21, 2019",2,"Great service as we arrived and ordered. The appetisers (both raw or slightly cooked) then took a very long time to come. After finishing we waited another 30 minutes or so with no food only be told the main dish would be at least 15 minutes more. This was after being there already for 90 minutes. The appetisers were very good so it’s a shame they can’t deliver on timing (and the restaurant was half full). We ended up leaving, cancelling the rest of our order m and picking up something at the grocery store for our daughter as it was just too long to wait. Not sure I’d recommend this place and it definitely doesn’t deserve its ranking on TripAdvisor."

Then we ordered 1 vermicelli with beef but there was very little amount of beef, it smelled very bad and the vermicelli was watery, besides everything being very cold. The other dish was rice with chicken.. oh my god the most disgusting thing.  The rice was cold, old and all together as a ball; it was not separating. Not eatable at all. The chicken was thick, cold, wet and cooked very bad. Even the side salad was awful. We left our dishes unfinished and left, letting the personal know about our terrible experience in a polite way. The lady said she would get the kitchen know and still let us pay 39€! Never going back again,  our stomachs are upset and I hope you never will think about entering this place!"

3247,YOLO restaurant-bar,I1094RClarss,"July 16, 2021",1,The menu Card on the Internet is not the same like in the Card in the local. Bad kitchen for vegetarians. The service is disastrous If you didn't consume for more than 100 Euros. The toilets are unreasonable. A place for the pseudo money nobility of Rotterdam. One of badest places in town!
3248,YOLO restaurant-bar,Plaszicht,"February 28, 2020",3,"Made it clear in my reservation that we wanted a nice table with a bit of privacy because we had many things to discuss during dinner. Bad luck, first a half hour wait, and then a tight table between 2 other parties. Dinner was OK, nice food, friendliness of staff average."

3251,YOLO restaurant-bar,29fleurh,"September 30, 2019",3,"The restaurant is nicely decorated, although the seating is somewhat tight. Staff is friendly, but beware of the fact that they have two shifts. If you have the first shift, you are requested to leave when you're time is up. The starters we had, were reallly very tasty (the tuna lolly &amp; carpaccio). The warm dishes after these, the crab and the foie gras, were disappointing. 
What really was disturbing was the smell of the sewing system. Not nice at all.
To conclude, I can say that it was an average dining experience in a nice decor."

About half of the dishes tasted great, the others were more interesting than good. The wine pairing was a mixed experience with some great wines and others that just didn’t match the food."

Today I had a 6 course dinner and it the experience was quite different from the previous one. The waiting time was rather long, and not all the courses were really surprising in terms of taste. To be honest I was a little bit disappointed about the food. Maybe my next visit will turn into a 4 star rating."
3395,FG Food Labs,822peterk,"November 25, 2019",5,"Great cooking. Every course looked like a Van Gogh painting and tasted marvelous. Staff members know what they’re doing. Wine choices somewhat conservative, but who cares?"
3396,FG Food Labs,Alex B,"November 1, 2019",4,"A great opportunity to have a Michelin-star food in an informal, cool atmosphere. The concept of 5 dishes course where each dish is a surprise from the chef makes the experience unique. Each dish is accompanied with detailed explanation from waiters both about the dish and the ""right"" way to eat it. My highlight were the smoked eel and the lamb chop which were fantastic - but also other dishes were unusually delicious and beautifully served. 
However, the whole dinner took well over 3 hours. Not sure if this is chef's intention or slow service in a busy day (the place was quite full) - I would happily give it ""excellent"" if it would take less time."

Instead of trying to help, the HMB staff were passive, slow and brief in their responses to my enquiries. It took them almost a week to respond to my first email and never replied to my second email. I had to call from abroad to ask for the details of arranging takeaway. Then I switched to contacting them via Whatsapp, as recommended by the staff on the phone. Yet the staff were slow and brief in their replies. The only time I got an immediate response from them was after I'd placed an order. But it was because the chef thought I was ordering for 4 people, while I was actually ordering a 4-course meal for one person. When I wanted to clarify the payment method, they simply stopped replying. How rude. I had a very unpleasant experience with HMB. A note for them is: If your restaurant does not want to offer takeaway service, then do not even offer in the first place. And if overseas order is not possible, then simply reply to explain."

The food was well prepared, nicely presented and very tasty and all accompanied with some good wine .Definitely a place to return."
3527,HMB Restaurant,483hansv,"December 10, 2019",4,"The quality of the food is superb and we had a great dinner. The sweetbread is really to die for! Also we had a great selection of wines. A small portion of fries for €6 is too much, should just be included in the price. That was a bit of a disappointment."
3528,HMB Restaurant,783AndrewT,"December 8, 2019",4,"We dined here during a visit to Rotterdam, looking for somewhere special for our last night in the city. This restaurant with attractive decor and river views fulfilled our criteria. We were nicely greeted and seated in a quiet corner table. Food commenced with amuse bouche tasters, all good and a nice greeting. The parmesan cream filled choux especially good.

Shared starters of oysters with ginger, Dutch shrimp croquettes and beef spring rolls were all tasty and beautifully presented.  

For mains we chose a fillet of sole with beurre blanc sauce and sweetbreads.  Again, both dishes were lovely and fresh and well executed. 

Another pre dessert amuse of small ice cream comes with sorbet and apple were refreshing.

Desserts of banana tiramisu and mandarin sorbet with chocolate were a nice finish to the meal.  Coffee and madeleines were served after.

We chose a good 2016 Mercurey from the large wine list, the 2015 vintage noted on the list wasn't available.

Service was generally good although a little slow and inattentive towards the end of the meal.  We would return again however and recommend."
3529,HMB Restaurant,Ingeborg_NL81,"November 17, 2019",5,"Excellent food and a nice ambiance. The place has a fancy look. The food is very tasty, and the accompanying wines that we had were truly excellent! The service was a bit slow after we were just seated, but improved later on."
3530,HMB Restaurant,Jax_Lea,"September 19, 2019",5,"We visited here this evening as we were in town for a conference. There were 8 in our party. The menu was chosen for us by our host (6 course). All of the food was beautifully presented and tasted amazing. I follow a low carb diet and the staff were really attentive to this and even provided me with an ice cream... made out of cheese!
If you like fine dining this is definitely recommended. I thought we were well looked after by the staff."
3531,HMB Restaurant,sdma04,"June 19, 2019",1,"Ate there with my husband but we vowed never again. Beautiful decor, very classy and the menu while being expensive had tasty food. I wouldn’t mind paying for it but the dreadful service simply was too much, by the owner no less!!! The entire time the owner, ignored all of the “regular” customers but tripped over herself to shower attention on the “special” customers (3 different tables). It became comical to watch the rest of us in the restaurant to get her attention to fill up with water or another glass of wine. It became infuriating when more than 20 minutes went by and having to stand up and walk over to catch her attention. 

At the end of the meal, I expressed my disappointment with the experience and the clear preferential treatment to the special tables. Rather than acknowledging it and trying to make amends; she stated that yes, this did happen but these people were more regular customers so she would treat them better!!! I could not believe what was being said. Not only admitting it but feeling that the poor treatment of the other customers was okay because this “two tiered” system of special vs regular guests. 

As much as I liked the decor and food, NEVER will I pay money to a place that intentionally treats me less than another paying customer. Ridiculous! 

Anyone who goes there and is not one of the special group- be warned you will not be treated particularly well and still walk out with a bill of more than 230 euros for two people!"
3532,HMB Restaurant,RoddyPayne,"May 28, 2019",5,"treated by by rich friends, we had the 4 course Euro 65 menu. It was delicious and beautifully presented with exciting textures and flavors. One of the best meals I have had in a long time. I think you need to book as this place is popular and be prepared to spend money as it is not cheap - but it is worth it if you like food. 

I did not have wine - off the booze for 4 years now - but my hosts had some yummy wine by the glass - not cheap, but well presented and discussed with the wine master.

The service is Dutch so don't expect any fawning or groveling - speedy and straight up and down."

3629,Spirit Rotterdam,leahstourtales,4 weeks ago,2,"I ate here a few times when I lived in Rotterdam for 4 months. I really liked the food and I think the sheer joy of having so many vegan options made me overlook the very expensive price. I returned to Rotterdam this week for a visit and decided I would go back to Spirit. I’m on a tight budget, as a young adult traveller. I felt anxious that I would accidentally spend too much. The ‘pay by weight’ model means that it’s difficult to budget as you really don’t know how much the final price will be. In order to ensure that the food would remain within my budget, I took what I truly thought to be a very small amount of food to the till to check the price. It was €12 already. I thought to myself okay, I haven’t eaten much today so I could do with a bit more food and spending perhaps 15€. So I added some more to my plate, a very small portion of rice, another (small!) piece of seitan steak and a bao bun. Went back to the till where they weighed it, and it came to €20!!!!! I was so shocked. I had tried so hard to keep it within budget and yet still the total came to €20. I didn’t even get a drink or anything, just ate tap water.

To make matters worse, a few of the tables were dirty. I also found the restaurant to be lacking in décor and atmosphere.

I thought to myself: right I’ve spent 20€ on this singular plate of food so I’ll do my best to enjoy it and relax here for a bit. Then, my powerbank ran out of charge. My phone also ran out of charge, so I looked for an outlet. I looked all around me for one, but there were no outlets at all. Not only had I been ripped off for the food, I couldn’t even use the space to relax and charge my phone before heading out again to see some sights. It was a problem because I wasn’t super familiar with the area. I ended up having to leave earlier than I had wanted in order to find a coffee shop (thereby spending more money) to charge my phone. 

I even asked the workers at the till whether they had any outlets for me to charge my phone at, and they just said ‘no, sorry’. Honestly they were quite dismissive and unhelpful. I was quite taken aback as usually in such a situation, the workers would at least tell me a nearby place that would have outlets, or ask if I was okay, or needed directions. Even before that, I didn’t get a good vibe from the staff. 

It’s also self-serve/buffet style which makes the expense seem even more like a rip off as you have to do everything yourself"
3630,Spirit Rotterdam,Freespiritednomad,"September 14, 2020",5,"Self-service buffet-style at 3 euros/ 100g of food. I loved the quality and variety of different organic and vegan options.

I usually go for dinner, but they have breakfast and lunch too. Also recommended to go for coffee and cake. All vegetarian and all organic. Ingredients are listed for all dishes and lots of symbols to indicate allergens and vegan. 
If it's full downstairs, you can go up and on warmer days, you can sit outside. The organic supermarket is next door and take away also an options."

But best of all, i ate one of my all time favourite main in this restaurant, the Iberico. It was simply superb.

Highly recommended"
3765,Restaurant Chung,TCPP,"June 21, 2019",5,Absolutely great meal. Had the four course €37.50 set menu which included duck done three ways for the main course. Perfectly cooked duck with delicious sauces and accompaniments.
3766,Restaurant Chung,Dinish,"May 4, 2019",3,"Self acclaimed best Peking duck of the nation. Well, no, not by a mile. Restaurant appears to be a Chinese fusion restaurant. Which for some reason means “not crispy Peking duck”, which is if I’m not mistaken the most essential part of the classical, legendary dish by its Chinese ancestors. 

Chung fails at the Peking Duck. Big time. Not crispy, made on the table. Undefined pickles, and skin with substantial part of meat. 

It’s not bad, but definitely not good. 

Tried the 4 course Peking Duck menu. Round 2 soup disappointed as it missed any spice and no kick. Round 3 tertiary processing of the duck. Only the black bean had flavor, but again misses the kick. Dessert not noteworthy to mention. At 37.50 eur per couvert have to say not expensive. But starting with a highly disappointed Peking Duck is a real let down."
3767,Restaurant Chung,GackMon,"March 15, 2019",5,"Came here for conference and tour and chanced upon this restaurant from Trip Advisor’s recommendations for our anniversary dinner. Food- We ordered the chef’s 4-course creation. 1) tuna/salmon sashimi and scallop - the sashimi was flavourful and different dimensions to the taste - the scallop was nice, but seemed overpowered by the cream
2) cod fish with lobster
- delicious with different variety of toppings and accessories. The semi-cooked lobster was marvelous! One of the best I have eaten so far
3) Peking duck pancake
- this is nice, but my personal preference is the one from Singapore
4) Steak with sweet potato sauce
- steak was tender and tasty, well accompanied by the sauce and sides

Service-
Waitress and waiter are well mannered and friendly. Contrary to what some had said in their review, I think their service was quite prompt, though the rate came down when the restaurant became more crowded.

Ambience-
Nestled in the canal and accessible. About 13 minutes walk from Marriott hotel and the central train station

Overall, I will definitely recommend this place!"

We all had the days special which was the most perfect schnitzel I have ever had, the schnitzel was flavoursome, tender and juicy and unlike the schnitzel of other places this is not fried so it is free of frying grease.

The food here is always fresh which is why each day they have the days specials and I can attest they are very fresh and excellent.

We arrived and were immediately made welcome by the ""lady of the house"" and when seated she advised us to have that days special, the afore mentioned Schnitzel which was served with fresh vegetables cooked to perfection with a side of fries that were crisp and golden, I had the banana with rum for a dessert and I have to say that too was extremely delicious.

This restaurant will provide you with tap water to drink if you ask which is great as other restaurants charge ludicrous amounts for bottled water and the tap water is free.

I heartily recommend this place for the friendly atmosphere, the excellent food and the decent price..."

4088,Olympia Kitchen Bar,Dumz,"July 4, 2021",3,"The food is great, but don’t expect Greek. It’s just Greek inspired. For example, the Gyros don’t come with bread like they normally supposed to, but rather just the meat inside, with fancy potato and salad on the side. There is a platter which is great to order if you’re with a group of minimum 4 people. 
The Musakka is not the tastiest and can be skipped. 

The Olympia gyro comes with all meat imaginable on one plate. The pork mince within this is the tastiest. 

Oreo Nutella cheesecake in desserts is again a nice invention here. Calorie bomb, but tasty. 
Mille Fuille is a caramel custard version. Pretty decent, but need to be had hot."

Accidents happen and given the fact we had to wait more than 1 hour for our dishes (a chicken souvlaki and biftecki with shared sides) when other clients who arrived after us were served way faster was a clear indication we were forgotten. We tried to catch a waiter’s attention but it took some time. The food was excellent but we were hoping for a «&nbsp;sorry&nbsp;» or a drink on the house. None came. We did enjoy our meal but it could have been slightly better.

4259,91Spices,Esploratore,2 weeks ago,1,"We ordered from 91 spices from a renowned delivery provider we have used for years with dozens of restaurants - order & pay - delivery timeline indicated 35 minutes - 10 minutes after order, delivery timeline indicated: 60 minutes - after 70 minutes the app said - out for delivery/confirmed by restaurant
- 30 minutes later - nothing (restaurant is max 5-10 min away by bike)

- we call the restaurant. They indicate delivery hasn’t even left yet, there is no delivery person.
- when we asked for new timeline there was none. “Maybe 10-15-30 minutes” 

So we are 100 minutes after order - with 35 min expectation. And NO new delivery timeline.

No apology
When wanting to cancel - taking no ownership, saying they cant do anything, refund, etc. 

I know there is a delivery provider in between but with previous issues using the same provider the restaurants have always picked up themselves and owned.  And these are much smaller things like missing a drink.

Amazing this place - completely respectless and still no money back. Few more days and I will be forced to file a police report for fraud."
4260,91Spices,64andrep,"August 15, 2021",4,It’s been around 3 years I did not eat Indian food as where I am living now there are no Indian restaurants so it was a very nice finding when I saw this restaurant just in front of the hotel we are staying. To be honest we went there for convenience as it was first restaurant we saw after a long car journey but it became a very good surprise. The owner gave us a table outside and the waitresses did a very good job and of course the food was delicious. We are staying for some days in Rotterdam and will be visiting the city often for some years to come and for sure this place will be one we will be coming back to.
4261,91Spices,MariscaZusje,"July 27, 2021",1,Ordered food last Sunday and spent the whole evening in my bathroom fomenting. Never again! Don't order the lamb or any thing at all

Starter was lovely and very flavoursome, not so much the main. I had a korma. It had no flavour at all, none of the usual coconut, creamy sweetness, it was very bland. I live in Eindhoven and there is a much better Indian restaurant here."

I love the food and the service, the restaurant makes me feel like I'm actually in India. The madras was too spicy for my friends so they gave us some raita (yoghurtsauce) to eat with it. Strawberry mojito's are cheaper than most places and really good. Coming back soon :)"
4266,91Spices,Jasna013,"October 1, 2020",2,"Decided to visit based on the reviews. Firstly: we have made a reservation for 6:30pm, however, when we arrived we were told that reservations for dinner are made on two shifts basis - till 7pm and after 7pm, so that we will need to wait for a couple of minutes. Those couple of minutes took precisely 45 as we were seated at 7:15pm. In the meantime, we were told to take a seat at the bar; no one showed any interest in us, no one offered us any drinks until we asked for it (if I am told that I need to wait for some time, I would expect at least a complimentary drink). Btw, this 'until 7pm-after 7pm' rule is not listed on the reservation page.
Secondly, unlike other tables, we were not served papadums with sauces while we were waiting for our food - reason unknown. Food was ok; however, service through ipads is not really working. Our orders could not go through so they had to take our ipad and they didn't bring it back until we asked what was going on with our food and drinks. None of the orders went through so we could have been sitting there for a while in case we did not initiate service. At the end, we received an invoice for two tables, not just for ours so that had to be sorted out as well on our initiative.
All in all, they are either understaffed so that is why some of the orders are quite late (we had to wait for our naan 20 minutes and it came when we have finished our meal) or there are other organisational issues they need to sort out."
4267,91Spices,CatarinaB43,"August 21, 2020",5,"Great Indian food, with friendly staff guiding us through the menu. 91Spices is probably the best Indian restaurant I have ever tried. I found the digital ordering system a bit cumbersome and would have preferred printed menus."

4495,Ter Marsch & Co,divenuts,"September 29, 2020",3,"I enjoyed the burger patty, it was cooked nicely (medium) but the amount of sauce was a bit overwhelming, so much so that it was hard to taste the meat. The ""award winning"" fries were ok but again too much stuff on them masking the taste of the fries. 
I ordered a bobbies gin and tonic and it was the smallest pour of gin I have ever seen, I only added half of the tonic and that was still too much for such a tiny amount of spirits. 
The waitress (young lady with blonde hair) was curt and came off as rude and impatient. Not someone that should be in a service job.

Very good service..!"
4802,Just Restaurant,pwbbost,"September 29, 2020",5,"We enjoyed an amazing three course lunch here! The chef knows very well what he is doing. Wow. We will definately come here to try the dinner menu! Also, the wines are sublime! See you soon!"
4803,Just Restaurant,tonyy471,"August 18, 2020",5,"I was in Rotterdam for a night, and walked past the restaurant ""Just"" by chance. I entered without knowing what food they'd serve and without checking online to see what other people would say about them. I really wasn't expecting anything, to my pleasant surprise, their food (and wine pairing) was AMAZING, far exceeding my expectations!!!!

They don't serve à la carte. You can choose between the 5-course or the 7-course option (at least that's the case for dinner). I wasn't particularly hungry, so I opted for the 5-course tasting menu:
- Caribbean cheese ball (as amuse-bouche)
- Sea wolf + lime cream sauce, carrot (2 ways), furikake, pumpkin seeds
- Steak tartare + celeriac (2 ways), shiitake, sakura leaves
- Crunchy mackerel + chimichurri, green herbs, fish oil
- Flat iron steak + red wine jus, green asparagus, pumpkin in beurre noisette, and Caribbean ""tutu"" of lentils and coconut 
- Lime cheesecake + crumble, banana sauce, forest fruit, homemade caramel, cinnamon ice-cream.

I also asked the sommelier for wine pairing. I was totally pampered. For the quality and creativity of the food &amp; wine, it's worth every single penny! I highly recommend this restaurant.

They change their menu every now and then. I look forward to having dinner there again when I visit Rotterdam next time."
4804,Just Restaurant,DeirdreK351,"January 1, 2020",5,"Ate here a few times, before this visit with family. They, like us on previous visits, enjoyed every dish. Great mix of flavours adding a nice Caribbean style to European way of cooking. Always nice to be surprised by their mystery menu. Excellent wine pairings with the dishes. 
Definitely worth a visit."
4805,Just Restaurant,StockholmKindaGuy,"December 27, 2019",5,"If you're someone who's adventurous and likes a surprise, Just Restaurant is – just what you're looking for. I stumbled upon Just Restaurant while looking for a nice spot to have my last dinner in Rotterdam. There's was a good crowd inside and I figured it was a good bet. It's a small casual and cozy place.

Here's where the adventurous part comes in. After being seated, I was told the restaurant didn't have a menu. The dishes served each day, you had a choice of a 3 or 5-course meal, were up to the chef. Surprise! I was asked if I had any type of food issues, I didn't, you may. I was in, you may not. I opted for the 3-course meal along with a glass of wine. The cuisine served here is a blend of French and Caribbean.

A complimentary item from from the chef came first, followed by three dishes artfully plated and perfectly paced. The first dish was a smoked fish that was wonderful. This was followed with a main course of chicken with root vegetables. The chicken was absolutely amazing. A tasty dessert was the final course. I was happy with the size of the portions, especially considering the price. Quite reasonable.

I know it's not easy eating in a restaurant where you're not sure what your going to be served, but every once in a while, it's nice to be adventurous.

Service was friendly and down to earth. I was made to feel like a local. The restaurant has a full bar and excepts credit cards.

If you're in Rotterdam, this might JUST be the RESTAURANT for you. I know I enjoyed it. It was among my top meals while in the Netherlands.

Just Restaurant is located close to a tram stop on Mauritsweg."

Sometimes a meal or two can seem pretentious or ""extra"" in its preparation, but it doesn't really matter, because it fits with the total concept, which is quite laid-back and purely serves as a treat for your eyes. It's not something you'd expect in a restaurant with this chic interior, but it truly warms my heart to see that there's a restaurant bringing food from the islands to this level."
4807,Just Restaurant,RTM1908,"December 2, 2019",5,"Anniversary dinner had a bit of a Caribbean twist this year. We went for Just's 5-course menu and man were we happy!

4809,Just Restaurant,soya66,"August 15, 2019",2,"4 of us had a dinner there in may and it wasn't a nice experience. #Environment: inside was small and stuffy, no AC or fan, some others customers moved out side afterwards. We sat outside, but the traffic was busy and noisy. # Each course took half an hour. So after 3 little pieces of food we were 1.5 hour there feeling really starving... And it was not possible to speed up.
#Food: Not up to expectations, to small for a normal adult. Main course was roasted chicken which was dry and tasteless. although there were various dips for it, the original material is still the most important. First two course were nice and small. Desert, not special. After 3 hours waiting and eating, we came home and cooked something else to fill out stomachs.... We are not big eaters."

They have lunch specials during the day too. Good service and very attentive."
4843,Cafe-Restaurant Rodin,783AndrewT,"December 7, 2019",4,"We dined here whilst visiting Rotterdam, looking for good cuisine and informal ambience. The food is French and Dutch and nicely presented. We started with a mixed meats platter, the wild boar and smoked duck very good. Also, we had the chicken livers with apple, also excellent. 

For mains,  we chose pheasant with lovely potatoes dauphinoise and sauerkraut.  The meat was succulent and tender, the accompaniments great, although the cabbage a little strong with vinegar, but not bad.

We also had the venison and creamy mashed potatoes.  A lovely dish with great game meat.

For dessert, we were full so shared a cheese board, all French varieties.  I would have liked a few Dutch choices too, but it was good.

The wine list isn't too extensive,  but we chose an ok Valpolicella.

Staff were very friendly and attentive.   A great place we would recommend and return to."

Whether it is for a normal night out and having a few drinks, having a great meal served up by the chefs, watching formula 1/soccer or having a private party…they offer it all! The service by the entire team is sublime and you can really see that they love their work. The menu isn’t the largest that you’ll find, but what they put on their is amazing! The fish and chips are by far the best in Rotterdam, the filet steak (which they offer besides their menu as a special) with pepper/truffle sauce is amazing and their ‘borrelplank’ offers a wide range of fresh products. I will always recommend this place to anyone! Thanks Cor and team!"

For me as a Czech it is also very interesting, that Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, first Czechoslovakian president, stayed in the hotel Wiemar, which used to stay on the place of cafe. Here the idea of how post-war Central Europe should be constituted, was firstly formed.
And thinking of that and drinking very tasteful IPA, is a very special moment."

4991,The Meatclub,143michaelj,"August 22, 2021",5,"We stumbled across this place by chance whilst walking and sat down to have a drink, saw the food and really wanted to eat, unfortunately there was no space as it was reservations only. I booked a table for 20:00 for the Saturday evening and it did not disappoint.

Service: 
The staff here are so friendly and welcoming and really explain the menu to you and actually come across that they are proud to work there and have passion for the job. 

Food:
5*5*5* all the way. I have lived in NRW Deutschland for 4 years and struggle to find a decent steak in a great atmosphere. Well The Meat Club certainly delivered on their restaurant name. Beautifully presented MR ribeye and sirloin on a board with a side salad and some home made chips, we added a pepper sauce. This was literally the highlight of my trip. I was in a steak lovers heaven with a large Malbec to wash it down. We decided to also order deserts and they were so tasty, 1 Creme Brûlée with a cherry sorbet and 1 chocolate cookie cake with a scoop of great quality vanilla ice cream. 

What we had: 
1x bottle Sauvignon 
1x glass Malbec 
1x Ribeye 
1x Sirloin
Chips 
Side salad
Creme brûlée 
Chocolate cookie cake 
1x glass Sauvignon 
1x double espresso 

Total €120.00
The easiest money I’ve ever spent on food."

You just got a new loyal costumer."
4995,The Meatclub,Magda B,"October 20, 2020",4,"The whole experience was mostly great! If you're looking to eat only meat - it's great! The starters are pretty big, the steaks cooked very well and the wine selection was very good! The only two things that bothered us that even though covid-19 restrictions were stated by the government and at first view the restaurant followed them, the waitress was coming very close to each table she was helping without any mask/hand cleaning/etc. that we saw in other places. And one of the starters was not great.
But overall we were happy when leaving."
4996,The Meatclub,Katherine I,"October 14, 2020",5,"I took the kids, who are studying at the local uni. We hadn't really intended to eat at such a nice place. Literally, we thought it was going to be a MacDonalds type place. So glad it wasn't. Pricey but worth every mouthful. We also had a lovely waiter who spoke with passion about the food and about the restaurant. The kids and I really appreciated that, it made it more authentic and personal."
4997,The Meatclub,BrummyTraveller,"August 13, 2020",5,"We have just finished the most amazing meal here. However it’s more like a culinary experience. The staff are so knowledgeable about the meat and it’s Uruguayan origins and are passionate about sharing this with their guests. Giovanny, our waiter this evening, made our visit extra special. He was extremely attentive, knowledgeable and kind. 
He advised us on the wine to accompany the chefs 3 cuts choice. We were able to sample the two wines we had narrowed down and enjoyed doing a blind taste test!
The meat was just wow!!!!! My husband. Nd I high said that we will never forget the taste of the meat. Incredible! 
The sides that accompany the meat were also cooked to perfection.
If you love your red meat and enjoy a culinary experience then this is the place to go.
We cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough. 
Keep up the good work!"

You two, combined with a real tasty and fine meal, showed, how it should be done. The service was just so friendly and nice, having some talks with you was a charm. But even more, the meat you served, was on point, like a I have never had before!!! The wine you proposed for the meal rounded it up! You are not thinking of making fast money, you really do provide quality and service!!  Please keep up your
 good work and your fine personality - :) :-)

And for all the people out there, visit Joep and Nikki, you won't regret it!!

4999,The Meatclub,bunnyofdarkness,"May 14, 2020",5,"We were really really lucky to get a table for dinner on the first night of our stay in Rotterdam. The place was very busy, despite being a week night and it is relatively small so we would suggest booking to make sure you aren't disappointed. The staff were very friendly and efficient. We were sat at a table which looked into the kitchen, this kept us well entertained during our meal and it was nice to see all the food being prepared. The quality of the meat was excellent, really excellent. We had the platter of meat in which the chef chooses 3 cuts for you and a side of skinny fries between us. The meat was beautifully cooked, seasoned and served relatively plain which meant you could really appreciate the flavour. It almost melt in your mouth and entirely worth the money we handed over at the end of the meal. If you like steak you need to try here."

5254,Atithi Indian Restaurant Rotterdam,Torquin01,4 weeks ago,3,"After reading the excellent reviews here on Tripadvisor, my wife booked this restaurant for a special occasion on a Saturday night at 19.30 hrs. After we stood in line outside, waiting to be seated, we were led to a table where we were provided only the drinks menu. Looking around, the place was packed with people looking at empty plates. After half an hour(!) we were asked if we wanted to order drinks and food. After that, we had to wait another HOUR just for our appetizers, without even a basket of Papadums to keep us from getting too hungry. When I made a remark to the waiter about it, he apologized by saying that it is very busy during weekends. That, however, should not be a legitimate reason for not even asking for drinks when customers are shown their table. He did apologize several times more, but did not check during the main course if everything was still satisfactory. Also, he could have offered us our coffes for free - which could have been an opportunity to set the bad service straight. By the way, I noticed that the waitresses were really slow and working inefficiently, so the delays should really not only be blamed on the kitchen. However, I must admit that the Chicken Tikka Masala was really good, and so were the vegetable dish and the Naan breads we ordered (the Samosa was too saucy to be enjoyed we felt). And the chairs in fhe restaurant are really comfortable. All in all, I can advise the restaurant for its food - just don’t go there during the weekend."
5255,Atithi Indian Restaurant Rotterdam,irfansherazi,5 weeks ago,5,"We had Dinner at Atithi and were very pleased with what we got at the cost range we paid.

5259,Atithi Indian Restaurant Rotterdam,N1273VXrajeshm,"August 23, 2021",4,"Yesterday me and my 86 year old mother had to be in Rotterdam for some work and decided to drop by for a quick Indian meal before heading back to Eindhoven as it was already past 8 pm. The restaurant was chock-full yet we were given a table by Hari and despite his claims that we had to expect a long waiting time, we were served our food within 20 min. I strongly recommend the Malai Kofta and Palak Paneer which were mild, not too spicy, somewhat sweet but delicioussssssssssssss. To be eaten with rice AND butter naan. It is somewhat pricy as we paid EUR 55 for 2 main dishes, 1 soup, 2 drinks and the same meal in Eindhoven would cost EUR 35-40 but then again, Nieuwe Werk is an expensive neighbourhood in Rotterdam. Overall, a very nice experience with friendly staff and delicious food...given the fact that me and mom are Indian. Well done."

5417,Zeezout,Finedininglady,"August 18, 2021",5,"Perhaps somewhat prejudiced I went to eat at restaurant Zeezout. With Patron Cuisinier Patrick ‘ t Hart i already had some nice conversations online about his just achieved star, the overwhelming reactions that came along with it, the corona crisis and what that crisis did to him and his family. My promise to him was that I would join him for lunch as soon as possible after the corona measurements went down, and so it happened.

Zeezout, located in the Scheepvaartkwartier in Rotterdam, has been in existence since 1998, Patrick is in charge there, but his wife Anet and his daughters can also be found in the restaurant. The interior is relax but elegant in which the beautifully inlaid shell tables stand out.

The menu is small with only some choices in oysters, 3 starters, 3 main courses and 3 desserts but literally everything is appealing. We order our picks and can’t wait to start our feast.

* look at the pictures for the food story or look either on instagram or my website*

Patrick, thank you for everything, you are one of the first restaurants I recommend in the Rotterdam area. no nonsense, just great food! I will definitely come back for a nice evening at your lovely restaurant."

5789,Restaurant Fitzgerald,Wilfried W,"August 28, 2019",4,"First class star-rated restaurant in a modern setting of glass and stone. With groups of 5 and over no à la carte dining but menus for the entire group. Prices are high, especially most of the wines, with an overwhelming choice at the high to very high price level.
The food was very tasteful, the service fine and friendly, the surroundings too noisy after a large group entered and took place in a separate part of the room behind us. We had to close the doors because of the noise. 
I prefer simpler restaurants with simpler offerings but if you want to splash out in Rotterdam you won’t be disappointed at the Fitzgerald."

The staff were pleasant and efficient, the surroundings comfortable: all in all a perfect evening.
Highly recommended."

Every course incl appetizers was an elegant dish using  first-class ingredients and super condensed flavors. The only hiccup being that flavors were sometimes overdone. As for wine I was positively impressed with the by-the-glass selection; very good producers. All in all a thoroughly great experience."

5937,Gastrobar Hartig,marjaanak2014,"August 7, 2021",2,"A visit to the restaurant was disappointing. We chose the Restaurant based on Tripadvisor’s recommendations, but were disappointed. The staff were friendly but they wera busy. The food was ok, but I wonder why the starter main course and dessert were brought to the table at different times. For example, one got their main course 10-15 minutes before the others. There were a long blond hair in a starter.

It was difficult to pay the bill. I had to try three different credit cards that were not accepted by the machine (embarrassing). Changing the machine helped.

I am most disappointed with this. I made a table reservation in time and wrote:

""Some wishies: we are from Finland and my son is moving to Rotterdam to study. This is our first Time in Rotterdam. He has also his 19th birthday. Can you note that Somehow, please 😄""

The restaurant replied, ""Thank you for your reservation. We notice it in our agenda.""

Nothing happened. I could have paid for the candle."

6065,Gastrobar Hartig,654harrietm,"July 25, 2015",4,"I ordered 2 dishes because the portions are quite small. Both dishes were delightful, especially the mushroom soup which smelt unbelievably good!

6066,Restaurant Fred,Honky_Richard,"August 12, 2020",5,"We had a dinner last night and went for the 6-course set menu. That was an excellent choice. The place is very modern, even slightly minimalistic, with a lovely atmosphere. The waiting staff is very welcoming, but not overly formal. Their sneakers are proof of that. The food was heavenly. There were exciting combinations of color, taste and texture. The plates are a joy to look at. To top this off, the wine pairings are exciting. For example, there was a northern Argentine white which had the nose of a dessertwine. I would not have picked this, but with a Langoustine dish in a fruity curry, it was brilliant. The sommelier picked other exciting wines (for example a Badische Spaetburgunder), which I don't drink very often. All of the were paired perfectly. Great place, warmly recommended."

Not about the quantity but quality of the food The delicious 7 courses, caring and friendly staff, ambiance the cleanliness is excellent 

I’d love to visit the place again. You can go with your friends, family, partner or whosoever you wish to.

In the end of our day we are happy and very satisfied."
6069,Restaurant Fred,ohhcuisine,"January 19, 2020",5,"With a grand status in the culinary world, 2 Michelin stars and over 20 years of gastronomic experience, we couldn’t be more curious about what chef Fred Mustert at his restaurant Fred in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, has to offer. The restaurant just underwent a major restyling, after which the interior got a warmer and more modern appearance. This restyling also is an element of the celebration of the 10 year anniversary of this renown place. We have to check it out!
 
Several elements grab your attention when you walk into the restaurant, such as a remarkable light tube hanging on the ceiling which finds its way to the whole area as a big signature.
 
To start, we may pick a kind of Champagne from the selection from the trolley at the table. We choose a rosé from Champagne house Billecart Salmon. Coincidental, we just visited this house a couple of days before during our most recent tasting trip to Champagne last week and this bottle of rosé was one of the few we hadn’t tasted yet. But we were glad we still had the chance to taste this absolutely delicious wine at Fred! Such a stylish, fresh, elegant and balanced taste.
 
A modern version of vitello tonato forms our first course. Ingredients of veal, raw tuna, basil, dashi and puffed rice together form a feast for the taste ánd eye senses. What a kick-off. We have had several modernized versions of this classic dish, but this one at Fred truly outstands the rest. For a moment, we even forget the horrible fact that there were no amuses to start our dinner with. We’ll come back to that later.
 
Because of this great start, our expectations of the following courses are high. The second course immediately manages to fulfill our hope for continuing this level of quality. Two appreciated delicacies on one plate: scallops and white truffle, placed on a bed of Granny Smith apple. The fantastic wine of winehouse Dönnhoff from Germany forms a winning match with this fresh dish.
 
A surprising red wine that forms an excellent partner for the main course of turbot, ravioli and white trruffle, is the pinot noir from Australian winehouse Ashton Hills. A wine that holds a low level of tanines and a high degree of acidity.
 
After our dessert of mandarin, coconut and tarragon, which again is a piece of culinary art, follows one of the main reasons to visit restaurant Fred alone: under the frandises to go with your coffee or tea, you will find the best madeleines you ever tasted. That is what we call completing a dinner in a tasteful way.
 
We could not help but ask where our beloved amuses were hiding all the time. Reason is that the lunch at Fred is quite a quick one, which is very much appreciated by the people visiting this restaurant in the center of busy Rotterdam for lunch in view of a business meeting. Ok ok, we accept then. In case you are such a big fan of amuses as we are, advice would thus be to visit this amazing restaurant for dinner instead of lunch, in view of exploring everything the restaurant has to offer.
 
No nonsense, that is what this restaurant is all about. The dishes are based on French cuisine, with a twist of Fred. Clean, recognizable dishes; no fuss with complex creams or gels on our plates – just pure, good ingredients which together result in daring yet to the point combinations you would like to have every day."
6070,Restaurant Fred,LiliFra,"June 29, 2019",5,"We love this restaurant and have been here many times. It has never disappointed us. Excellent food and wines, fantastic service, and people with a passion for what they do. Although it’s a Michelin Star restaurant it does not come with the regular uptight ambience. You can truly relax and enjoy the very special evening or afternoon they for sure will give you!"
6071,Restaurant Fred,787roderickp,"June 4, 2019",4,"High quality, nice food. Take your time to enjoy winelist gives you plenty options. I would save some room for dessert :)"
6072,Restaurant Fred,MattRobNL,"March 20, 2019",5,"Last week we had a lunch here and although the restaurant was full, it was such an amazing experience. Right from the start, with the beautiful entrance (including cheese cart view), until the moment you finish of your coffee/tea, this will be amazing. The food is absolutely great, the experience is extraordinary and the service is perfect. We have been here a couple of times, but every time it was such an amazing experience; we love it !"
6073,Restaurant Fred,Patjuhkip,"February 24, 2019",5,"We visited Fred for the 2nd time. After a great experience the first time the second one was even better. Great amuses 3x. A truffle veloute and then the 5 course menu kicked off. With coquille, tuna, duck, great wines and more. Including a really nice smoked burger guided by a stout beer, served as a pre main course snack. After the desert and some nice cheeses, we closed out this great evening with a selection of friandises guided by coffee and a glass of whiskey.

The main reason why Fred is such a great experience is because of the atmosphere. It is a Michelin 2* restaurant where people can be themselves and have fun. The crew understands its guests. And they know when to be formal and when it is time for fun. We were on the fun side! Keep it up Fred!"
6074,Restaurant Fred,Ynot R,"November 6, 2018",4,"My wife and I went here because we wanted typical French food. We didn't have much time to study the tourist sites and didn't know Michelin stars were involved, otherwise we would not have gone here. Years ago my favourite Brasserie in Paris (Chez Benoit) was visited by Princess Diana and received a Michelin star. I returned once to a place that had been ruined by that award.

Restaurant Fred turned out to have a very small menu card on each table which listed many courses of a so called gastranomic menu (fixed price at Euros 149.50)..

A very pleasant waiter began explaining each course to my wife when we told him we don't enjoy such multiple tiny courses.

He produced the a la carte and we chose a delicious dish of fillet steak.

It seemed to me that a red Sancerre would go well and I chose one that turned out to be one of the lowest priced wines on a long list. It was Euros 75.

So, no problems there.

The reason we would never return to this restaurant with its fine food and wines would have nothing to do with quality of dishes, price or service; it would be the dreadful atmosphere, forced upon it by the most bland decor I've ever seen in a restaurant except for the Hull New Theatre's restaurant.

It's that sort of a lack of colorful interior design that tends to cause diners to whisper to each other throughout the evening. 

This is, I suppose, encouraged by waiters who, the opposite of Italians, could not dream of coming to the table with a loud or musically-voiced welcome.   

They were, however, very professional and very pleasant.

Make up your own minds!"

6168,Kwiezien,X5265MZmaryw,"August 27, 2021",5,"I loved the concept of this restaurant. The menu offers 3,4 and 5 course dinners with complete flexibility. You can choose courses from any category. So you could pick 2 appetizers, a main and a dessert or 3 desserts. Every dish was beautiful and delicious. The owner/chef was moving about the restaurant advising customers with his knowledge,patience and sense of humor. We felt like we were guests in his home. Our personable sommelier, Jill, knew her wines. We were also fortunate to purchase a bottle of her wonderful “Lemonjillo” conceived during the pandemic shutdown. This restaurant has Michelin star quality food served with fun in an unpretentious atmosphere.  Highly recommend when in Rotterdam."
6169,Kwiezien,GerbenS1969,"January 26, 2019",4,"We visited Kwiezien a couple of weeks ago. It is located in Katendrecht which has become really trendy lately. There was a slight mistake with the reservation, so we had to wait 30 mins but that was handled nicely by giving us a course for free in the pub where we waited. You can take a 3, 4 or 5 couse menu and then you have the choice between 16 different courses. You can pick and choose any of them. Nice selection, fish and meat and vegan if that is your thing. Food was delicious, but I was a bit disappointed with the wines they served with each course. I think they were not really outstanding. Sevice was good, real informal Rotterdam style. I think a 4 course menu is around EUR 40, and accompaning wines EUR 30, but I would choose half glasses for EUR 15 approximately, as you get enough with that arrangement :)"
6170,Kwiezien,SanThom2000,"July 15, 2018",4,"We had a dinner on a Friday night at Kwiezien and opted for the chef’s table. The whole night we had a very nice interaction with one of the chefs, Dennis, who gave us a great insight in the way the kitchen is run. We went for the 4 course menu with wine pairing. Overall the food was good, even though there were some inconsistencies in the quality of every course. Outstanding were the crispy spare ribs. We had a fun evening at Kwiezien."
6171,Kwiezien,benlengyel,"June 16, 2018",5,"I have been out to many restaurants in the Netherlands and I think this is the best one I have been to. The dishes were full of flavour and I just enjoyed every mouth full. The staff were amazing and always happy to help or to answer any questions we had.

The 2 chefs were very chatty, very warm and inviting.

The wine selection was outstanding and it matched the dishes we had.

My wife and i will be going back for sure.

Thanks for putting us at the chefs table.

6174,Kwiezien,JoiadeJong,"January 2, 2018",5,"Kwiezien was a very pleasant birthday surprise in which my taste buds got a very new experience and that after 23 years! My concern with cuisine is always the portions, but after this lovely night I was more than full. Every meal was another adventure, one more tasteful than the other. The location is quite small, which gives Kwiezien a very intimate atmosphere. And well the service is simply excellent. 

I would especially recommend Kwiezien for special occassions. Although, it is definitely worth the pricetag, it should be said that it is more expensive than regular restaurants. For young people like me that makes it harder to visit often."
6175,Kwiezien,gurt65,"December 1, 2017",5,"Kwiezien is crowded on a Thursday night in november. Car parking was not a problem in the neighborhood. Remember, on the way to the parkingmeter (sometimes quite a walk) your registration number because that is what you need! At arrival we were friendly welcomed with a Rotterdam accent. We could – if desired – take a seat at the Chef's Table. We didn't know what that meant to be honest, but we agreed. We got 2 places allocated to the worksheet of the 2 chefs.
We could chat and ask every question we’d liked. The Chef was friendly and the talks were personal too. Not the obligatory things. Very nice!
At Kwiezien you choose a number (3,4,or 5) of courses -menu and then make your choice from menu.
We went for the 4 course menu and it turned out a perfect choice. You also can choose for a half-wine package. 
You drink different wines per dish and will not leave the restaurant with a headache. Good concept!
For the wine lover: the owner has her Master of Wine, so the wine is in very good hands in this restaurant. 
The food: you must discover it, because a journey it is. Delicious on taste, surprising choices and beautiful plates and bowls. In the meantime the chef told us what he was doing and also that Kwiezien has very close-knit team that cooperates fir years. That’s  a good sign. 
Chef's Table means, that as an extra between dishes, you’ll get a small example of the other dishes on the menu.
So we received 4 courses of our ordered menu and in between  3 small snacks (including the famous croquette of the house) from the other dishes.
Everything was equally delicious and original! 
Staf’s timing and friendliness is super. 
Kwiezien is a real winner!!!
(FYI: there is also a disabled toilet)."
6176,Kwiezien,808MarkP808,"November 8, 2017",5,"Booked to go on a Saturday evening. It was busy (full), but we got our table on time. The service was excellent. The staff were friendly. The food was really good. We had the 9 dish option, and that was more than enough... The wine list is limited, but it is reasonable value.  Will definitely go back!!"
6177,Kwiezien,turbodelia,"October 26, 2017",5,"What a nice surprise! Didn't know Kwiezien till we attended a business dinner. We chose the tapas experience, 9 beautiful dishes chosen by the chef. Pretty skeptical about the quantity and the food at first, till service started. One after the other beautiful and original dishes, served by a very professional staff. Impressive also how - however a pretty small place - the kitchen is so well organized that 22 people got served at the same time with no accidents. Great success"

6368,FG Food Labs,Alex B,"November 1, 2019",4,"A great opportunity to have a Michelin-star food in an informal, cool atmosphere. The concept of 5 dishes course where each dish is a surprise from the chef makes the experience unique. Each dish is accompanied with detailed explanation from waiters both about the dish and the ""right"" way to eat it. My highlight were the smoked eel and the lamb chop which were fantastic - but also other dishes were unusually delicious and beautifully served. 
However, the whole dinner took well over 3 hours. Not sure if this is chef's intention or slow service in a busy day (the place was quite full) - I would happily give it ""excellent"" if it would take less time."

6495,Restaurant Langoest,Caziah G,"August 1, 2021",5,I visited this restaurant in a moment of distress and deserved a treat. I live above the restaurant and have never been inside. The staff were accommodating and had knowledge of good wines and pairing sides with mains. I started with the oyster mix . FANTASTIC! Then the mussels ( these were not on the menu) FANTASTIC! Paired with the bread and thick chips. It was a great experience. I had no phone so it was me and my thoughts and good food and wine. I’d definitely return here. Pricey but worth every penny .. Cent !
6496,Restaurant Langoest,Magda B,"October 20, 2020",5,"I do not understand why the Langoest restaurant has so little reviews! The place is amazing! The food, the service, the view, the decor, was just perfect! My fiancee took me there for our anniversary dinner and at the beginning I was disappointed that we did not manage to get a table at a ""fancy"" restaurant, the moment we arrived, we were welcomed and then served the food.. all the disappointment went away in full! The octopus starter was the best octopus dish I have ever had (comparing to fine dining in Barcelona, restaurants in Greece, etc.), it's definitely a must try! Then we had the sea food mixed plater and it was just fantastic! Together with the soave wine it was just an amazing meal in a great atmosphere! Thank you!"
6497,Restaurant Langoest,s0oso0m,"March 11, 2020",5,"Could the view be any better? An amazing view at night next to Erasmus bridge. We made a reservation for 4 and we had a beautiful table next to the window overlooking the bridge. We couldn't decide what to take so we ordered a Fruit des Mers, ribeye, sashimi mix, oyster mix and octopus. price quality is good. We finished everything on the plate and even ordered dessert! thank you for the amazing experience!"
6498,Restaurant Langoest,Impaxer11,"January 19, 2020",4,Nice prices and really nice food. I will really recommend this restaurant. The food came quickly og tasted really fresh.

6500,Restaurant Langoest,Vicky V,"November 19, 2019",4,"We enjoyed an evening in this classy restaurant. The menu is based on classic cuisine, but with contemporary touches. We took the risk of the surprise menu, starting with nice bowl of sashimi of tuna and salmon, oyster and wakame, main course was the sea bass in salt crust, which we can only recommend!  For dessert there was a small but nice plate.  The price for this full menu was only 37 euro."
6501,Restaurant Langoest,liverpool1023,"November 16, 2019",5,"With a great view towards the Erasmus bridge this restaurant oozes style. The menu is relatively pared-down example of classic seafood dishes. For the starter I opted for the lobster bisque spiked with cognac. This was suitably rich and delicious. My main was halibut with eel sauce including brown shrimps. This was a lovely dish of food. 

My other half opted for the slightly more theatrical salt baked sea bass. The salt was expertly bashed with a small metal mallet and the fish prepared at the table. The result was purred over with enjoyment. 

Service is very friendly and attentive. The wine list is extensive and we were pleased with our choice of an Albariño."
6502,Restaurant Langoest,teppy83,"October 28, 2019",5,This is by far and away the best fish restaurant in Rotterdam. The menu is varied and interesting - e.g. sashimi & tuna steak alongside the classics like lobster - and the food is excellent quality. The staff also strike the perfect balance between attentive and discreet.
6503,Restaurant Langoest,SeanA756,"October 21, 2019",2,"Great service as we arrived and ordered. The appetisers (both raw or slightly cooked) then took a very long time to come. After finishing we waited another 30 minutes or so with no food only be told the main dish would be at least 15 minutes more. This was after being there already for 90 minutes. The appetisers were very good so it’s a shame they can’t deliver on timing (and the restaurant was half full). We ended up leaving, cancelling the rest of our order m and picking up something at the grocery store for our daughter as it was just too long to wait. Not sure I’d recommend this place and it definitely doesn’t deserve its ranking on TripAdvisor."

The sweet chili sauce was very nice. Then we ordered 1 vermicelli with beef but there was very little amount of beef, it smelled very bad and the vermicelli was watery, besides everything being very cold. The other dish was rice with chicken.. oh my god the most disgusting thing.  The rice was cold, old and all together as a ball; it was not separating. Not eatable at all. The chicken was thick, cold, wet and cooked very bad. Even the side salad was awful. We left our dishes unfinished and left, letting the personal know about our terrible experience in a polite way. The lady said she would get the kitchen know and still let us pay 39€! Never going back again,  our stomachs are upset and I hope you never will think about entering this place!"

6680,HMB Restaurant,EC30,"July 1, 2020",1,"I wanted to order takeaway from HMB for a friend living in Rotterdam to celebrate his birthday. Instead of trying to help, the HMB staff were passive, slow and brief in their responses to my enquiries. It took them almost a week to respond to my first email and never replied to my second email. I had to call from abroad to ask for the details of arranging takeaway. Then I switched to contacting them via Whatsapp, as recommended by the staff on the phone. Yet the staff were slow and brief in their replies. The only time I got an immediate response from them was after I'd placed an order. But it was because the chef thought I was ordering for 4 people, while I was actually ordering a 4-course meal for one person. When I wanted to clarify the payment method, they simply stopped replying. How rude. I had a very unpleasant experience with HMB. A note for them is: If your restaurant does not want to offer takeaway service, then do not even offer in the first place. And if overseas order is not possible, then simply reply to explain."

6684,HMB Restaurant,783AndrewT,"December 8, 2019",4,"We dined here during a visit to Rotterdam, looking for somewhere special for our last night in the city. This restaurant with attractive decor and river views fulfilled our criteria. We were nicely greeted and seated in a quiet corner table. Food commenced with amuse bouche tasters, all good and a nice greeting. The parmesan cream filled choux especially good.

Shared starters of oysters with ginger, Dutch shrimp croquettes and beef spring rolls were all tasty and beautifully presented.  

For mains we chose a fillet of sole with beurre blanc sauce and sweetbreads.  Again, both dishes were lovely and fresh and well executed. 

Another pre dessert amuse of small ice cream comes with sorbet and apple were refreshing.

Desserts of banana tiramisu and mandarin sorbet with chocolate were a nice finish to the meal.  Coffee and madeleines were served after.

We chose a good 2016 Mercurey from the large wine list, the 2015 vintage noted on the list wasn't available.

Service was generally good although a little slow and inattentive towards the end of the meal.  We would return again however and recommend."
6685,HMB Restaurant,Ingeborg_NL81,"November 17, 2019",5,"Excellent food and a nice ambiance. The place has a fancy look. The food is very tasty, and the accompanying wines that we had were truly excellent! The service was a bit slow after we were just seated, but improved later on."
6686,HMB Restaurant,Jax_Lea,"September 19, 2019",5,"We visited here this evening as we were in town for a conference. There were 8 in our party. The menu was chosen for us by our host (6 course). All of the food was beautifully presented and tasted amazing. I follow a low carb diet and the staff were really attentive to this and even provided me with an ice cream... made out of cheese!
If you like fine dining this is definitely recommended. I thought we were well looked after by the staff."
6687,HMB Restaurant,sdma04,"June 19, 2019",1,"Ate there with my husband but we vowed never again. Beautiful decor, very classy and the menu while being expensive had tasty food. I wouldn’t mind paying for it but the dreadful service simply was too much, by the owner no less!!! The entire time the owner, ignored all of the “regular” customers but tripped over herself to shower attention on the “special” customers (3 different tables). It became comical to watch the rest of us in the restaurant to get her attention to fill up with water or another glass of wine. It became infuriating when more than 20 minutes went by and having to stand up and walk over to catch her attention. 

At the end of the meal, I expressed my disappointment with the experience and the clear preferential treatment to the special tables. Rather than acknowledging it and trying to make amends; she stated that yes, this did happen but these people were more regular customers so she would treat them better!!! I could not believe what was being said. Not only admitting it but feeling that the poor treatment of the other customers was okay because this “two tiered” system of special vs regular guests. 

As much as I liked the decor and food, NEVER will I pay money to a place that intentionally treats me less than another paying customer. Ridiculous! 

Anyone who goes there and is not one of the special group- be warned you will not be treated particularly well and still walk out with a bill of more than 230 euros for two people!"
6688,HMB Restaurant,RoddyPayne,"May 28, 2019",5,"treated by by rich friends, we had the 4 course Euro 65 menu. It was delicious and beautifully presented with exciting textures and flavors. One of the best meals I have had in a long time. I think you need to book as this place is popular and be prepared to spend money as it is not cheap - but it is worth it if you like food. 

I did not have wine - off the booze for 4 years now - but my hosts had some yummy wine by the glass - not cheap, but well presented and discussed with the wine master.

The service is Dutch so don't expect any fawning or groveling - speedy and straight up and down."

6785,Spirit Rotterdam,leahstourtales,4 weeks ago,2,"I ate here a few times when I lived in Rotterdam for 4 months. I really liked the food and I think the sheer joy of having so many vegan options made me overlook the very expensive price. I returned to Rotterdam this week for a visit and decided I would go back to Spirit. I’m on a tight budget, as a young adult traveller. I felt anxious that I would accidentally spend too much. The ‘pay by weight’ model means that it’s difficult to budget as you really don’t know how much the final price will be. In order to ensure that the food would remain within my budget, I took what I truly thought to be a very small amount of food to the till to check the price. It was €12 already. I thought to myself okay, I haven’t eaten much today so I could do with a bit more food and spending perhaps 15€. So I added some more to my plate, a very small portion of rice, another (small!) piece of seitan steak and a bao bun. Went back to the till where they weighed it, and it came to €20!!!!! I was so shocked. I had tried so hard to keep it within budget and yet still the total came to €20. I didn’t even get a drink or anything, just ate tap water.

To make matters worse, a few of the tables were dirty. I also found the restaurant to be lacking in décor and atmosphere.

I thought to myself: right I’ve spent 20€ on this singular plate of food so I’ll do my best to enjoy it and relax here for a bit. Then, my powerbank ran out of charge. My phone also ran out of charge, so I looked for an outlet. I looked all around me for one, but there were no outlets at all. Not only had I been ripped off for the food, I couldn’t even use the space to relax and charge my phone before heading out again to see some sights. It was a problem because I wasn’t super familiar with the area. I ended up having to leave earlier than I had wanted in order to find a coffee shop (thereby spending more money) to charge my phone. 

I even asked the workers at the till whether they had any outlets for me to charge my phone at, and they just said ‘no, sorry’. Honestly they were quite dismissive and unhelpful. I was quite taken aback as usually in such a situation, the workers would at least tell me a nearby place that would have outlets, or ask if I was okay, or needed directions. Even before that, I didn’t get a good vibe from the staff. 

It’s also self-serve/buffet style which makes the expense seem even more like a rip off as you have to do everything yourself"
6786,Spirit Rotterdam,Freespiritednomad,"September 14, 2020",5,"Self-service buffet-style at 3 euros/ 100g of food. I loved the quality and variety of different organic and vegan options.

I usually go for dinner, but they have breakfast and lunch too. Also recommended to go for coffee and cake. All vegetarian and all organic. Ingredients are listed for all dishes and lots of symbols to indicate allergens and vegan.

The staff is really quick and friendly, the atmosphere is lovely, and the ramen is absolutely delicious: the soup is extremely flavourful but not overly salty, and the noodles are just perfect.

Good dining atmosphere and friendly staff."

Super tasty with black garlic oil and juicy pork belly!
Their portions are more than enough and the price is absolutely fine. 
Expect to pay between 11-15€ for a bowl of Ramen.
Also their side dishes like the Gyoza are super good!

6924,Hinoki,lechatpoche,"September 7, 2019",3,"As we have arrived, we needed to wait 20 minutes to be seated, the queue was standing outside. We placed our order efficiently because, within the 20 minutes outside, we have already made up our minds. From the moment we have received the drinks, it took 42 minutes till we got our soups. Within this time we asked politely, if they haven’t forgotten about us, as every table got their orders. We were told, that the water for cooking noodles needed to be changed. Hungry children equals complaining children. Also, music in the restaurant was pretty loud - it was pretty exhausting. Therefore, one point less. 
As to the food- the teriyaki chicken and special red were absolutely delicious. I would wish a little more depth in taste. To be fair, We got the second round of drinks on the house, as a gesture of good will for waiting. I appreciate it, so I left the tip, but I got the impression that if we would not complain, they wouldn’t offer any apologies."

7032,Oliva,patrizzzz,"August 8, 2019",5,"We had a wonderful dinner at oliva. The staff was very helpful and friendly. They have fine wines and digestifs. We had the zander (snoekbaars) with the black rice and purple carrots. The fish had a subtle taste which contrasted well with the more outspoken taste of the rice and carrots. The rosé and white wines we had during lunch matched the food perfectly. Finally, the waiters were very helpful and friendly."

The staff put up with our long stay and maybe bit enthousiastic behaviour which we greatly appreciated."
7035,Oliva,Florence30-04,"January 16, 2019",5,"We wanted to treat ourselves with a very good restaurant while in Rotterdam and we decided to take a chance on ""Oliva"". Warm welcome, good cocktail and appetizers (this basil olive oil!) to start off, we opted for the 5-course ""surprise menu of the chef"" with wine pairing and we couldn't be happier with our choice. 
Excellent service and cuisine, amazing wines : we were over the moon. 
You'll pay a little more than in any other ordinary restaurant, but it's definitely worth it !
Do not hesitate and get yourself a great night at this place!"
7036,Oliva,wherethetwainmeets,"October 12, 2018",3,"Sometimes I get trapped in an Italian restaurant abroad, an old friend arranged it. The first course was an carpaccio of with funghi, rucola and some stuff I could not recognize. For I do not like liver in pasta the second course was orecchiette with an not familiar tomato sauce, that was a bad idee. The third course was a filet di dorade grilled, not baadt all, but it can be better for a terrone. Fortunately we drank different kinds of excellent wines . The fourth course was a desert with grappa. 

For I am used to the Southern Italy kitchen with  a lot of vegetables, fresh fish etc, and my wife is excellent in the kitchen I am n bit biased to evaluate Italian restaurants especially abroad."

They have lunch specials during the day too. Good service and very attentive."
7132,Cafe-Restaurant Rodin,783AndrewT,"December 7, 2019",4,"We dined here whilst visiting Rotterdam, looking for good cuisine and informal ambience. The food is French and Dutch and nicely presented. We started with a mixed meats platter, the wild boar and smoked duck very good. Also, we had the chicken livers with apple, also excellent. 

For mains,  we chose pheasant with lovely potatoes dauphinoise and sauerkraut.  The meat was succulent and tender, the accompaniments great, although the cabbage a little strong with vinegar, but not bad.

We also had the venison and creamy mashed potatoes.  A lovely dish with great game meat.

For dessert, we were full so shared a cheese board, all French varieties.  I would have liked a few Dutch choices too, but it was good.

The wine list isn't too extensive,  but we chose an ok Valpolicella.

Staff were very friendly and attentive.   A great place we would recommend and return to."

Service is very friendly with a smile. Every time i dine here, it reminds me of my time living in Hong Kong (actually my goodbye party when leaving for HK was organised on the beautiful terrace of Chung). But best of all, i ate one of my all time favourite main in this restaurant, the Iberico. It was simply superb.

Highly recommended"
7223,Restaurant Chung,TCPP,"June 21, 2019",5,Absolutely great meal. Had the four course €37.50 set menu which included duck done three ways for the main course. Perfectly cooked duck with delicious sauces and accompaniments.
7224,Restaurant Chung,Dinish,"May 4, 2019",3,"Self acclaimed best Peking duck of the nation. Well, no, not by a mile. Restaurant appears to be a Chinese fusion restaurant. Which for some reason means “not crispy Peking duck”, which is if I’m not mistaken the most essential part of the classical, legendary dish by its Chinese ancestors. 

Chung fails at the Peking Duck. Big time. Not crispy, made on the table. Undefined pickles, and skin with substantial part of meat. 

It’s not bad, but definitely not good. 

Tried the 4 course Peking Duck menu. Round 2 soup disappointed as it missed any spice and no kick. Round 3 tertiary processing of the duck. Only the black bean had flavor, but again misses the kick. Dessert not noteworthy to mention. At 37.50 eur per couvert have to say not expensive. But starting with a highly disappointed Peking Duck is a real let down."
7225,Restaurant Chung,GackMon,"March 15, 2019",5,"Came here for conference and tour and chanced upon this restaurant from Trip Advisor’s recommendations for our anniversary dinner. Food- We ordered the chef’s 4-course creation. 1) tuna/salmon sashimi and scallop - the sashimi was flavourful and different dimensions to the taste - the scallop was nice, but seemed overpowered by the cream
2) cod fish with lobster
- delicious with different variety of toppings and accessories. The semi-cooked lobster was marvelous! One of the best I have eaten so far
3) Peking duck pancake
- this is nice, but my personal preference is the one from Singapore
4) Steak with sweet potato sauce
- steak was tender and tasty, well accompanied by the sauce and sides

Service-
Waitress and waiter are well mannered and friendly. Contrary to what some had said in their review, I think their service was quite prompt, though the rate came down when the restaurant became more crowded.

Ambience-
Nestled in the canal and accessible. About 13 minutes walk from Marriott hotel and the central train station

Overall, I will definitely recommend this place!"

7276,91Spices,Esploratore,2 weeks ago,1,"We ordered from 91 spices from a renowned delivery provider we have used for years with dozens of restaurants - order & pay - delivery timeline indicated 35 minutes - 10 minutes after order, delivery timeline indicated: 60 minutes - after 70 minutes the app said - out for delivery/confirmed by restaurant
- 30 minutes later - nothing (restaurant is max 5-10 min away by bike)

- we call the restaurant. They indicate delivery hasn’t even left yet, there is no delivery person.
- when we asked for new timeline there was none. “Maybe 10-15-30 minutes” 

So we are 100 minutes after order - with 35 min expectation. And NO new delivery timeline.

No apology
When wanting to cancel - taking no ownership, saying they cant do anything, refund, etc. 

I know there is a delivery provider in between but with previous issues using the same provider the restaurants have always picked up themselves and owned.  And these are much smaller things like missing a drink.

Amazing this place - completely respectless and still no money back. Few more days and I will be forced to file a police report for fraud."
7277,91Spices,64andrep,"August 15, 2021",4,It’s been around 3 years I did not eat Indian food as where I am living now there are no Indian restaurants so it was a very nice finding when I saw this restaurant just in front of the hotel we are staying. To be honest we went there for convenience as it was first restaurant we saw after a long car journey but it became a very good surprise. The owner gave us a table outside and the waitresses did a very good job and of course the food was delicious. We are staying for some days in Rotterdam and will be visiting the city often for some years to come and for sure this place will be one we will be coming back to.
7278,91Spices,MariscaZusje,"July 27, 2021",1,Ordered food last Sunday and spent the whole evening in my bathroom fomenting. Never again! Don't order the lamb or any thing at all
7279,91Spices,sprincey,"July 2, 2021",3,"Was really looking forward to my visit as my friend really rates this place. Service was friendly and really good. Starter was lovely and very flavoursome, not so much the main. I had a korma. It had no flavour at all, none of the usual coconut, creamy sweetness, it was very bland. I live in Eindhoven and there is a much better Indian restaurant here."
7280,91Spices,Frans_klaassen,"December 31, 2020",5,"Great food, we have been eating and had food delivered a few time already. It’s always excellent. For X-mas we had their X-mas dinner special. It was absolutely great..and even with a nice dessert added for free [thank you so much] From our trip in India we brought Thali plates...which created a real nice atmosphere and something special for x-mas"
7281,91Spices,MMKKRR,"October 7, 2020",4,"Excellent curry korma! We also had the tikka curry, which was also great. They also have a good selection of spirits."
7282,91Spices,kamiliaaah,"October 1, 2020",5,"Third time I went here and it's still my favourite Indian restaurant. I love the food and the service, the restaurant makes me feel like I'm actually in India. The madras was too spicy for my friends so they gave us some raita (yoghurtsauce) to eat with it. Strawberry mojito's are cheaper than most places and really good. Coming back soon :)"
7283,91Spices,Jasna013,"October 1, 2020",2,"Decided to visit based on the reviews. Firstly: we have made a reservation for 6:30pm, however, when we arrived we were told that reservations for dinner are made on two shifts basis - till 7pm and after 7pm, so that we will need to wait for a couple of minutes. Those couple of minutes took precisely 45 as we were seated at 7:15pm. In the meantime, we were told to take a seat at the bar; no one showed any interest in us, no one offered us any drinks until we asked for it (if I am told that I need to wait for some time, I would expect at least a complimentary drink). Btw, this 'until 7pm-after 7pm' rule is not listed on the reservation page.
Secondly, unlike other tables, we were not served papadums with sauces while we were waiting for our food - reason unknown. Food was ok; however, service through ipads is not really working. Our orders could not go through so they had to take our ipad and they didn't bring it back until we asked what was going on with our food and drinks. None of the orders went through so we could have been sitting there for a while in case we did not initiate service. At the end, we received an invoice for two tables, not just for ours so that had to be sorted out as well on our initiative.
All in all, they are either understaffed so that is why some of the orders are quite late (we had to wait for our naan 20 minutes and it came when we have finished our meal) or there are other organisational issues they need to sort out."
7284,91Spices,CatarinaB43,"August 21, 2020",5,"Great Indian food, with friendly staff guiding us through the menu. 91Spices is probably the best Indian restaurant I have ever tried. I found the digital ordering system a bit cumbersome and would have preferred printed menus."

7382,Olympia Kitchen Bar,n0rwina,"August 3, 2021",5,Wow. We were blown away! Excellent food and service. Lamb chops were to die for. We also had the tenderloin in a redwine sauce. The Santornini one of their signature dishes was soooo good. Our server provided great recommendations and service. This restaurant is highly recommended and is a must try when visiting Rotterdam.
7383,Olympia Kitchen Bar,Dumz,"July 4, 2021",3,"The food is great, but don’t expect Greek. It’s just Greek inspired. For example, the Gyros don’t come with bread like they normally supposed to, but rather just the meat inside, with fancy potato and salad on the side. There is a platter which is great to order if you’re with a group of minimum 4 people. 
The Musakka is not the tastiest and can be skipped. 

The Olympia gyro comes with all meat imaginable on one plate. The pork mince within this is the tastiest. 

Oreo Nutella cheesecake in desserts is again a nice invention here. Calorie bomb, but tasty. 
Mille Fuille is a caramel custard version. Pretty decent, but need to be had hot."
7384,Olympia Kitchen Bar,daninal2017,"July 21, 2020",4,We had a lovely meal at the Olympia kitchen bar. The terrasse was full and there were also quite a few clients inside. Accidents happen and given the fact we had to wait more than 1 hour for our dishes (a chicken souvlaki and biftecki with shared sides) when other clients who arrived after us were served way faster was a clear indication we were forgotten. We tried to catch a waiter’s attention but it took some time. The food was excellent but we were hoping for a «&nbsp;sorry&nbsp;» or a drink on the house. None came. We did enjoy our meal but it could have been slightly better.

Highly recommended to anyone in this area of the city. Particularly enjoyed the mixed starter - presented on a 3 tier stand.

We travel the world to eat, and I must say that I did not expect to say this, but FG Restaurant in Rotterdam is for sure one of the top on our list. Floris the Somelier is also tops. Bravo Francois!!"
7463,FG Restaurant,LaMoSo,"September 18, 2020",3,"We came here to celebrate my birthday. Before coming, we checked the website to see the menus they had available. I must say the website is terrible, the carrousel keeps spinning before you can read anything. I took screenshots of the menu that we considered. We decided that since we are not so much into deserts, we would have the 5-course tasting menu and order a cheese platter for dessert instead of having the two desserts all the other menus come with.

On arrival, they told us that it was not possible to order the 5 or 6-course menu because it was a Friday. That information is nowhere to be seen next to where it shows the menus. Since this resulted in a total of 80 euros extra than we had planned, we ended up not having our cheese platter.

The food itself was good, however, the service was extremely slow. It took 30 minutes to bring the first amuse, the whole dinner took about 4 hours, and I believe this was only because we told them if they could hurry a little bit. It was midnight by the time we left. 

There was also an incident with the wine pairing. I had the idea that pairing meant to pair food and wine. However, there was no coordination between the waiter and the kitchen. The wine would arrive sometimes 20 minutes before the food, by the time the food was there either there was no wine left, or the white wine was already room temperature. I complained about this, and they tried to coordinate a bit better, however, the speed in the kitchen was dragging the whole service down. I felt a bit sorry for the host, to be honest.

All in all, the restaurant is beautiful, the servers are nice, the food is tasty, but the speed and the missleading information are a dealbreaker for me. I am not expecting fast food, but a bit of tempo does not hurt. It is the second time I am in a restaurant from FG and both times I had a similar experience. I do not think I will ever return here."
7464,FG Restaurant,FabienneS354,"January 9, 2020",2,"Beautiful interior decoration, food that for us just about met the two stars the restaurant received, but service unfortunately miles away from two star level. In summary: very nice bread-serving staff, but lack of one waiter per table system and very bad planning. They even did not take the effort to check the receipt before handing it over: they overcharged our table of 8 with about 350 euros due to bad administration. We will never be back nor recommend this place.

We asked a waiter at 8pm what menu he would recommend as we needed to leave at 12AM. He (told us he) checked with the chef and confirmed the full 9 course menu would be fine. At 11:45 PM we still had 3 courses to go and we had to ask ourselves what was going on?! Without even apologizing or any type of communication they decided to skip one course and rush out the 2 deserts, the 2 wines (of which the self-made one was truly superbad, our group of 8 all confirmed) and the coffee ALL at once! Quite inappropriate (we would have been happy to just finish with one desert!) And they had no difficulties in charging us the skipped course ánd the extra ordered truffle we never received due to the late evening rush. They did correct the bill after we asked. But in one word: astonishing, how you can undermine your Michelin reputation in such a way. We will never go back nor would recommend this place."
7465,FG Restaurant,christyhylau,"December 28, 2019",1,"My family and I went to the restaurant at 12:00pm (opening). We complained twice to the waiters about the pace of the meal and still ended the meal at 4:30PM. We sat for 2.5 hours before our first course was finally served. Somehow the tables that came in after us got served first and left before us. When a waiter came to ask us for our feedback, we told him the food was good but the service attitude and pace was way too slow. He said he didn’t want to make excuses but still managed to make 2 excuses such as they were really full but they could’ve anticipated the demand as every table booked in advance and had to pay 50euro deposit for the restaurant. 

My family and I went to Rotterdam for a day trip and wasted all our time at this restaurant and we would’ve opted for something else If they informed us. 

When we got our meal, we were quite surprised for a lunch that we had spent over 600 euros for a meal (already deducted the 150euro deposit we had made prior). Don’t think I’m ever going to come back or recommend this."
7466,FG Restaurant,wilsonae,"November 28, 2019",5,"My wife and I ate at FG Restaurant on a Tuesday evening as part of the 'Dining with the Stars' special offer. We were warmly welcomed when we arrived and immediately shown to our seats. After three amuses and bread, we were served with our five courses (two fish, one celeriac, one meat and one dessert).  We also took the 'Bob'-wine arrangement which gave us a half glass of wine that was selected to match each of the five courses.  
We finished off with coffee which was accompanied by a selection of chocolates, macaroons and ice-cream.  The only negative was that, although my wife's main course was perfect, mine was a bit tough and fatty.  When we commented on this, we were brought an additional 'amuse' with the apologies and compliments of the chef.  
What was also interesting was that when we were served with the bread a large box was brought to the table which contained 12 different types of salt.  Our favourite was a smoked salt from Washington State.  After the salt there was another box with 12 different types of pepper that we could pick and then ground with the mortar and pestle that was on our table.  We were also allowed to select the knife that we wanted to use from a large tray full of different knives that the chef had personally chosen.
Last, but definitely not least, all of the staff were very friendly and helpful and are a credit to the FG Restaurant."
7467,FG Restaurant,atwos63,"September 28, 2019",3,"Of course one becomes very demanding when it comes to a Michelin starred restaurant ... but if the experience triggers too many aggravations, it deserves a mediocre review. The food was very good but the plates were often incomplete (we made it a joke among friends to see what one was missing ...)The chairs were very un-convivial (felt like being on a board meeting - so big you can't talk to your neighbour) the service was un professional (we wondered if some servers were missing) ... it is a shame for such a talented chef to get shaded this way. But all of the above can be easily improved - There is hope !"
7468,FG Restaurant,gt6210,"September 7, 2019",3,"Overall the food, the experience and the gimmicks were good but not perfect, Three dishes we had were exceptionall (Cod, Lobster), two dishes were good but did not surprise (Carpaccio, tenderloin) and the dessert was a hit and mis. The dish was really polarizing especially when compared to the rest of the menu. The cheeses &amp; friandises were amazing.

I do feel that the service was a bit inconsistent especially for a two star. In the system you don’t have your own waiter. the restaurant seems to be struggling to choose between formal and informal.  some staff  were very approachable and friendly but a number of others were uncomfortable in their role and it was very hard to “connect” with them. Two plates were removed without any communication and we waited far to long on our coffee and bill, not a good way to end the night!

Overall it was a fun night out it is always great to be pampered. FG restaurant has good  food and nice staff but we will not return here soon."
7469,FG Restaurant,Muis123,"July 31, 2019",1,"This was one of my worst restaurant experiences ever! I really cannot understand how you can have such a horrible service and be ok with it. It started when we arrived. We went at our table and the waiter left. After some minutes another waiter more or less threw the menus on our table and left. Some minutes after I stopped one of the waiters to ask about the tasting menu which he explained briefly to us.

After that finally the waiter came to take our order for the drinks. I didn't want to take any alcohol which seemed to be a problem. The waiter appeared to be annoyed and kept insisting(!?!?), to get him of my back I ordered an alcohol free cocktail of € 13,- (orange juice with soda or so).

Later they left a box with different types of salt on the table. I had to stop another waiter to ask why they had left the box on our table. He explained us that you can take two and mix them your self. Personally I prefer following the restaurant recommendation but since no one explained anything that was not an option. Later while I was still reading the descriptions about the different types of salt another waiter came and closed the box and took it (really!?!?).

After this I complained about the service to one of the waiters but he had no idea what to do with my complaint he was completely lost.

Later for the meat we could pick a knife from the private collection of the chef. Whoow lucky us! The waiter try to make us feel like privileged people for having this option, pfffff. The piece of meat was so small that I only had to cut it twice. Here I also would prefer a normal knife instead of this fake show.

The best moment of the day was when we left this cicrus.

I you are a new rich hipster who wants to impress his girlfriend who never went to a fancy restaurant you might enjoy it here. If not go somewhere else (i.e. restaurant Fred in Rotterdam).

Two positive points: the food was actually not bad and there was a Spanish waiter who was friendly and correct."
7470,FG Restaurant,tousja,"June 19, 2019",5,"It was my husband's birthday and our second visit to this restaurant. We booked it in advance and were asked a 100 euro deposit. Not so pleasant beginning. We chose a 6 course menu with matched wine. We started with a glass of champagne, Legras &amp; Haas, great champagne.

The food was delicious and splendid. Very interesting combinations. Good timing between courses. Needless to say, the wine was perfect. The staff was professional and very friendly. We enjoyed that evening much."

Would definitely revisit Azura in the future."
7638,Azura,Quest31840441004,"November 3, 2018",5,"I was on my own and wanted some sushi. So I went there alone on a Saturday night without reservation....that's always tricky naturally so I was not surprised to find that they were fully booked. However, the manager/owner found me a table anyway with the friendly sidenote that it was reserved from 20:00 onwards (it was 18:30). That was no problem for me.

I simply asked the waitress to serve me a selection of sushi and sashimi that she liked herself. They arrived super quick and tasted pretty good (though I don't eat sushi very often). While eating, a couple of friends walked by the restaurant and saw me dining, so they decided to join me. Within 30 seconds they were served by the friendly waitress at my table as well, super quick and friendly again. 

At 19:45 the manager/owner came to our table, asked if everything was ok and friendly reminded me that the table was reserved in 15 minutes. We were all aware and due to the quik service, we were in no rush by any means. 

So if you're looking for some nice sushi, served quickly and with a genuine smile: Azura might just be the place you're looking for."

These guys managed to find us a place in a second and treated us in an excellent manner."
7674,Little V,SaraCala1,"August 20, 2021",4,"Location service and cocktails 5 ⭐️. Food 3 starts. I went there once for dinner and once for lunch. Vegetarian and non vegetarian didn’t find the food so tasty. Cocktails are very good.With a few drinks and appetizers the price per person is around 55 euro.

I think worth to try it."
7675,Little V,Joanna R,"August 14, 2021",4,"I'm underwhelmed. Food was tasty, but not intense enough, green papaya salad was rather bland, and served with prawn crackers (!!!sorry, I spent a month in Vietnam, ate out every day and not even once was served these crackers!), beef tenderloin stir fry very well cooked, tender and tasty, but not very Vietnamese, lacked flavour, chili sauce saved it for me... it all has potential but is was too europeanized. Service, hmmm, triple underwhelmed.  I was alone, obviously the least interesting type of customer,  I was given beef first and they forgot my salad which was supposed to be a starter... he finally brought it after an hour. Eventually he took it of the bill, which was a nice gesture and reason to give 4 and 2 stars;)"
7676,Little V,vikip346,"August 9, 2021",1,"I used to be a regular client and a big fan. I am very disappointed by the way the service changed after a corona.1st time I waited for a drink for 30 minutes, 2nd time I waited for a drink for 30 minutes, and my partner for 50 minutes. I wanted to give it the last shot 2 weeks ago and ordered food and mentioned I will come back in 15 minutes to pick it up. Came back, nothing was ready, had to ask 3 waiters to help me, took me another 30 minutes waiting, order came, but was not complete. After we finally received our order, they gave it to us and we left. Afterward, a waiter ran behind us and asked us to show bill. HORRIBLE service!"

7958,Little V,PVR2,"August 17, 2013",3,"Little V successfully tries to cash in on the smart formulas of the sushi & Asian food businesses and quite rightfully so. We had the words there: small springrolls, sauteed fish or meat and the natural abundance of fresh veggies & cool beers. Great place...More"
7959,Little V,Juliette B,"August 15, 2013",3,"I’ve eater here twice now and both times I really enjoyed the food (good quality), but not the service and noise level. To start off with the food – the menu is 4 pages, so pretty extensive and everything is available ‘vegetarian style’ (which scores...More"
7960,Little V,Alessandro B,"June 15, 2013",2,"Was surprised that i could only find two little shrimps in the noodle shrimp soup. I asked the waiter how many i should have and he said five! He returned a few minutes later with two extra shrimps, which were still a bit cold, explaining...More"
7961,Little V,samlproever,"May 20, 2013",5,"We ate there yesterday evening, and it was very good! The staff spoke very good English, and tried their best to recommend us dishes. The quality of the food was good too! If your looking for a good Vietnamese meal, go here!"
7962,Little V,Thuy1510,"April 25, 2013",3,"Enjoyed food at this restaurant last year. Quite delicious Vietnamese food but not ""original"".

7963,Little V,Francois1975,"April 23, 2013",5,"Great vietnames food ,Gambas where great. Good selection of Vietnamese dishes. Pho soup was nice as well. Ice-tea and cocktails are really nice as well. If you want rice with the dishes make sure to order it as it is a side dish."
7964,Little V,Beriha,"March 7, 2013",4,"Was wondering about this place and went here with a friend last week. We ordered the springrolls, chickenwings and fish cakes as a starter. They all tasted very nice. For the main course I had a special of gamba's with some vegetables and white rice...More"
7965,Little V,frontmill,"January 31, 2013",2,"I went here a few hours ago, and it was a real disappointment. It took them about half an hour to take our preferences for drinks and another 10 minutes to bring them, although the place was quite empty. When I asked for a menu...More"
7966,Little V,Dirk S,"January 30, 2013",4,"This restaurant, tucked away in a little street behind the Great or St. Laurens Church offers delicious Vietnamese food. I really recommend their surprise menu."
7967,Little V,JieYongK,"January 13, 2013",4,"We went here on a sunday evening for dinner. We had some appetizers (the cold spring rolls, regular spring rolls, the beef in a type of leaf) which all were nice and refreshing. Our mains were the noodles (with the regular raw bean sprouts, etc...More"
7968,Little V,RenM188632,"December 11, 2012",3,"iti s a nice restaurant just next to the eldest church (Grote Kerk) of Rotterdam. The menu card is fine, with a lot of choice. Be careful the portions are rather small. So you have to eat a few of them not to be hungry...More"
7969,Little V,Grindler,"October 15, 2012",5,"It is fresh, surprising and tasty food!! A nice variation of the Thai food. Friendly staff and nice interior."
7970,Little V,George S,"October 14, 2012",2,"Nice, but fake Asian interior with uncomfortable chairs. Food is autenthic and acceptable, but does not offer more than any cheap place. Price-value ratio is below average. Ingredients were fresh and tasty. Pho arrived luke warm, which is major problem with that kind of soup....More"

7972,Little V,Slutbunwaller,"July 24, 2012",4,Delicious.

7975,Little V,cybergabi,"June 15, 2012",3,"Little V is in a great downtown location, and they are very tastefully decorated. They offer 'Dutchified' Vietnamese food, arranged in a pretty way, but not with many vegetarian or vegan options. It's also really pricey - maybe due to the downtown location. When we...More"
7976,Little V,DACHALADACHA,"June 12, 2012",4,"Nice environment, liked the atmosphere but though the food tasted real ood, I found it quiet over prized for the quantity they are serving"
